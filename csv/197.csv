While we can agree that doing laundry isn’t the most exciting thing you’ll experience in college, it’s a necessary one. Your dorm room storage probably isn’t the biggest, so instead of wishing you had a little more closet space for your garments, think about investing in a clothing rack! They’re a great way to display your most loved pieces of clothing while also helping to keep everything organized. While most students don’t usually pay much mind to the brand of detergent they use, Tide maintains a great balance between thoroughly washing and maintaining the structural integrity of your clothes.
