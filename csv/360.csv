270,201,p,"If you love Pilates and you feel ready to invest in your at-home set-up, a Pilates reformer can be a great buy. Reformers are large pieces of equipment you can use to tackle all kinds of strength-training exercises, and Balanced Body’s Allegro Tower of Power is one of the most splurge-worthy options around.",n
276,201,p,"The reformer comes equipped with a sliding carriage, which can serve as the base for all your go-to reformer exercises. And since that base is outfitted with adjustable shoulder pads and a three-position headrest, you can rest assured knowing you’ll stay cushioned and comfortable during your workouts. The reformer also boasts an extra-wide footbar, which you can adjust both horizontally and vertically to ensure your reformer fits just right—no matter your height.",n
278,201,p,"What sets the Allegro Tower of Power apart, though, is its tower attachment. “This combo machine is great because it supports the exercise repertoire from both the reformer and Cadillac,” Bauer explains. “The exercises are endless. And as you become more familiar with the machine, you can begin to create your own exercises and flows using every inch of the tower.” To help you make the most of the tower, the reformer comes with a range of accessories: a push-through bar, a roll-down bar, and a set of loops. Combined, all these accessories—plus the tower and the sliding carriage—should enable you to tackle complex Pilates workouts from the comfort of your own home.",n

345,294,p,"The reformer boasts a sliding carriage, which you can use to tackle a range of classic Pilates exercises . And since that carriage is outfitted with foam shoulder pads and an adjustable headrest, it should keep you comfortable, whether you’re sitting or lying down. At the foot of the sliding carriage, you’ll find a springy rebounder, which you can use to make your workouts even more interesting. And if you’d prefer to keep things classic, don’t worry—you can always remove the rebounder and trade it with a standard footbar , instead.",n
349,294,p,"These features should give you the basis for some great reformer workouts . And if you want to make things even more interesting, you can take advantage of some of the many accessories this reformer ships with. Buy the reformer, and you’ll receive a set of adjustable ropes, straps, and handgrips, as well as a set of stretchy resistance cords. For good measure, you’ll also receive two Pilates workout DVDs, which can help you get started with your brand new machine.",n

421,355,p,You can get a lot done with a Pilates ring—known by many as a “Magic Circle.” So it’s no surprise that two of the Pilates instructors we spoke to—Gerrard and Rockovich—recommended adding one to your collection.,n
423,355,p,"Now, there are plenty of great Pilates rings out there. But ProBody’s Pilates Ring is a particularly great option. Why? At 5.43 ounces, it’s lightweight enough to carry with you on the go. But since it’s crafted from durable composite material—and encased in a protective plastic laminate and soft foam cover—it should be sturdy enough to last you a while. The ring promises to maintain its springy strength over time, delivering reliably challenging workouts every time you use it.",n
425,355,p,"To keep you comfortable, the ring comes equipped with padded handles, which you can grip with your palms, thighs, ankles, and more. Since the ring can be used during strength training, stretching, and balance training, it’s sure to become a go-to in your Pilates routine.",n

496,431,p,"If you don’t have the space or budget for a reformer, rest assured knowing you’re not out of luck. There are two primary methods of Pilates , and reformer Pilates is just one of them. The other is mat Pilates. And all it requires is—you guessed it—a Pilates mat.",n
500,431,p,"Though BalanceFrom’s GoYoga Exercise Mat is technically a yoga mat, it possesses many of the features you’d expect to find in a Pilates mat. The high-density foam mat is 0.5 inches thick. That makes it thicker than most standard yoga mats , and much closer in thickness to a Pilates mat . This added thickness should help you comfortably tackle mat Pilates exercises, while giving you the versatility you need to tackle yoga exercises, too.",n
504,431,p,"At 71 inches long and 24 inches wide, the mat is also a little larger than your average yoga mat. And it should be big enough to comfortably accommodate people of many different heights. All this said, the mat is slip-resistant , rather than slick . This feature may put off avid mat Pilates fans. But if you’d prefer not to own two separate mats for yoga and Pilates, it should be versatile enough to get the job done.",n

570,513,p,"If you’re looking for a piece of Pilates equipment that’s both challenging and space-efficient, Gerrard recommends investing in a Pilates chair . “I feel the Pilates Wunda Chair is definitely underrated and overlooked,” she says. “It’s known to be the most challenging piece of Pilates equipment.” According to Gerrard, you can use a Pilates chair to strengthen your arms and your legs, while also challenging your back and core. And since it’s the size of an average chair, it’ll demand way less space than a reformer.",n
574,513,p,"As is the case with a lot of Pilates equipment, Pilates chairs can get expensive. But the AeroPilates Precision Pilates Chair offers solid quality without breaking the bank. The sturdy chair is designed to support you as you tackle a range of strength-training exercises. And its base is equipped with grippy end caps, which should keep the chair from slipping or sliding mid-workout.",n
576,513,p,"For boosted comfort, the chair is outfitted with a padded platform and padded cushion—as well as padded handlebars and pedals. And since both its height and handlebars are adjustable, it should comfortably suit you—no matter your height.",n

636,580,p,"The set comes with three resistance bands, each of which measures 5-feet long and 4-inches wide. To keep things interesting, the color-coded bands come in three different resistance levels. The yellow one should deliver 3 to 4.3 pounds of resistance, the red one should deliver 3.7 to 5.5 pounds of resistance, and the green one should deliver 4.6 to 6.7 pounds of resistance. And if 6.7 pounds of resistance simply doesn’t sound like enough, remember that you can always layer the bands to increase the resistance you’re encountering.",n
638,580,p,"Unlike resistance loops, these bands are open-ended, meaning you can grip one end with each hand. This design should give you the flexibility to use the resistance bands in a few different ways, and it should allow you to shorten them whenever you see fit.",n

712,645,p,"Compared to Pilates reformers and Wunda chairs, Synergee’s Core Sliders may look a little unassuming. But according to Bauer, if you’re willing to get creative, you can use sliding discs to level up many of your favorite exercises.",n
716,645,p,"Buy a set of Synergee Core Sliders, and you’ll receive two small sliding discs—each measuring 7.2 inches in diameter. The dual-sided discs are crafted from soft foam on one side and slick plastic on the other, so you can flip them over to adjust your experience on different kinds of floors. Synergee recommends pairing the soft foam side with slicker floors to cut down on slipping. Likewise, the brand recommends pairing the slick plastic side with softer floors to keep yourself challenged when you’d otherwise have too much traction.",n
718,645,p,This clever design makes the sliding discs great for working out at home—or for bringing with you on the go. Simply place your hands or feet on top of the discs during your go-to exercises to add a layer of core strengthening to all your workouts.,n

774,725,p,"All three of the instructors we spoke to—Gerrard, Rockovich, and Bauer—recommended snagging a Pilates ball . Their reasoning? Pilates balls are versatile, budget-friendly, and space-efficient. So they can be a great way to level up your at-home Pilates workouts. And if you’re looking for a classic Pilates ball, it’s pretty hard to go wrong with URBNFit’s Mini Pilates Ball.",n
778,725,p,"The ball is crafted from durable PVC. And since it’s inflatable, it should feel a little like a balance ball . The only difference? URBNFit’s Mini Pilates Ball is about the size of a medicine ball, so it should be small enough to place between your ankles, below your hands, or underneath your back during workouts.",n
782,725,p,"The ball is designed to withstand up to 600 pounds of pressure at a time. And since it’s anti-burst, it should never pop underneath you. Instead, it should gradually deflate—a feature that should keep you from getting an unsettling surprise mid-workout.",n

840,789,p,"Arc barrels offer a classic way to stretch and strength-train during a Pilates session. The small piece of equipment is shaped like a half-cylinder, giving you a flat surface to rest on the ground, a mat, or a cadillac, and an arched surface to explore during your Pilates workouts.",n
842,789,p,"There are several great arc barrels out there, but since Merrithew’s Arc Barrel is lightweight, portable, and padded for comfort, it’s a particularly great option. The arc barrel is cushioned with soft EVA foam, so it should keep you comfortable as you stretch and exercise. And since it’s designed to be used on a cadillac or a Pilates mat, it should stay securely in place as you move around.",n
844,789,p,"Though the Arc Barrel will demand more space than some of the other items in this shopping guide, it’s still a pretty small piece of equipment. The arc barrel is 23.5 inches long, 22.5 inches wide, and 6 inches tall . So it shouldn’t be terribly hard to make room for in your space.

899,848,p,"Looking for a way to build even more strength during your Pilates workouts? Consider strapping on a pair of wearable weights . Wearable weights—which can be worn on your wrists or ankles—add an extra layer of strength training to classic Pilates moves, making exercises you’ve mastered feel challenging again. And since wearable weights abound, you can snag a set that’s exactly as heavy as you want.",n
903,848,p,"One great option? Gaiam’s Ankle Weights. The weights are crafted from mesh and neoprene, so they should feel pretty comfortable. And they come lined with Velcro strips, which can help to fasten them tightly around your ankles. Once fastened, the weights should stay firmly in place—meaning they shouldn’t slide around as you exercise.",n
905,848,p,"The ankle straps are sold in pairs, and they’re currently available in two different weights. Start with a beginner-friendly 5-pound set , or go all-in on a 10-pound set . Either way, you’ll end up with a convenient way to make your favorite Pilates workouts even more challenging.",n

963,912,p,"Socks aren’t a must during Pilates. But if you want to wear them—and if you don’t want to start slipping and sliding all over the place—it may be worth it to invest in a pair of grip socks. Grip socks look and feel a lot like normal socks, but their soles are lined with grippy dots. These dots lend the socks traction, helping you stay on your feet and in control whenever you wear them.",n
965,912,p,"Toesox’s Bellarina Half-Toe Grip Socks boast this classic grip dot detail. But they take the traction another step further: The socks are toeless. Each sock comes equipped with five small holes, which you can slide your toes through to expose them. This exposure makes it even easier to maintain balance and control as you work out. And since the socks are designed to hug the base of each toe, they should stay firmly in place as you move around.",n
969,912,p,"The socks are crafted from a blend of soft cotton and stretchy spandex, so they should keep you comfortable during your workouts. And they’re currently available in three standard sizes: small, medium, and large.",n

But according to Club Pilates instructor Tanya Rockovich , springboards can be just as useful. “Everyone loves the reformer,” Rockovich says. “But the springboard offers a ton of creativity and really challenges our balance and helps us build functional stability.”",n
1034,973,p,"Often, you’ll see a springboard attached to a reformer. But with Balanced Body’s Pilates Springboard, you can score the springboard and forgo the reformer—saving space in the process. The large board measures 72 inches tall and 20 inches wide, and it mounts directly onto your wall to free up floor space. Lining both sides of the board, you’ll find a series of hooks. These hooks can attach to all kinds of classic Pilates accessories—like springs, roll-down bars, and more—giving you plenty of options, as you go to craft dynamic Pilates workouts.",n
1036,973,p,"Because stocking up on equipment can get tedious, the Pilates Springboard ships with a few accessories to get you started. Buy the springboard, and you’ll also receive two standard springs, two long springs, two loops, two handles, and a roll-down bar. The set also includes all the hardware you’ll need to hook up these accessories. And the springboard comes with a built-in footbar you can use to anchor yourself during springboard exercises.",n

1096,1040,p,"For starters, the PiYo Base Kit isn’t one workout DVD containing a single workout. It’s a full-blown workout program—complete with ten different workouts, which you can watch across three different DVDs. This variety should be enough to keep you going for a while.

1117,1111,p,"Of course, when it comes to Pilates equipment, a reformer isn’t your only option. ProBody’s Pilates Ring is a classic piece of equipment you can take with you on the go. TheraBand’s Resistance Bands are great for building strength, whether you’re tackling a Pilates workout or logging a cross-training session.
