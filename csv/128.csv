68,62,span,"No sophisticated flower arrangement would be complete without some floral netting or wiring. If you haven’t heard of floral chicken wire already, it is a tool many florists use that replaced floral foam which is a petroleum-derived product that can’t be reused and contains formaldehyde. Chicken wire is used to support the shape of your floral arrangement if there is no vase to support it or if the container is not deep enough. Floral Chicken Wire can be cut-to-size and used for centerpieces, large urns, or floral installations, as well as smaller floral designs. It is also eco-friendly and reusable making it one of our top recommendations if you want to elevate your floral designs to the next level.",n
