497,6,p,"If you’re serious about table tennis, you’ll want to invest in a custom-made racket. Premade table tennis rackets might be cheaper and require less effort to set up, but they offer far less flexibility in terms of both playing style and quality of components.",n

501,6,p,"In addition, the side tape is placed around the racket to protect it from hitting the table. This usually happens with pimps or short balls when you can attach them, so it would be good to have side tape to make your racket last as long as possible.",n

With a smaller plate thickness, the ball jumps incorrectly and may slip. The cheap table tennis tables have a lower thickness. The tournament play table price is around $ 1000.",n

598,595,text,"are entirely different from others for other sports. They are made so that they do not slide so much. At the same time, your foot is light in them so that you can move faster. Soles are the most important when choosing table tennis shoes. Take a look at our reviews on Butterfly Shoes .",n
602,6,p,"That’s because they are made to be flexible so as not to lose balance. Also, table tennis shoes still protect you from injury. If you play in different shoes not intended for this sport, you can seriously worsen your footwork.",n
604,6,h3,What is special about table tennis shoes?,n
605,6,p,,n
606,605,text,Table tennis shoes are vital for anyone who wants to play the game at a competitive level. They are designed to,n
608,605,strong,reduce friction and provide good grip,n
609,605,text,", making it easier to move around the table.",n
611,6,p,"In addition, table tennis shoes have a thin sole that helps to prevent injuries. While other pieces of equipment, such as table tennis bats, are important, table tennis shoes are essential for anyone who wants to play the game at a high level.",n
613,6,p,"However, if you are playing on a hard concrete floor, the lack of shock absorption in your shoes can lead to joint problems. It is therefore advisable to wear table tennis shoes with thicker soles if you are going to be playing on concrete.",n
616,6,p,"Another disadvantage of table tennis shoes is that they don’t provide much grip. This can be a problem if you are playing on a slippery surface, as you may find it difficult to keep your footing.",n
618,6,p,"In addition, the shoes can also be slippery on the sole of your opponent’s shoe, making it difficult to get a good grip on their shoe for a serve or return.",n
620,6,p,"Finally, table tennis shoes can be quite expensive, especially if you are looking for a top-of-the-range pair. However, if you are serious about playing table tennis, then investing in a good pair of shoes is definitely worth the money.",n
623,6,h2,Accessories,n

672,6,p,,n
674,672,strong,"When choosing a good-quality glue, it is vital to get sponges and a sponge gripper in the package.",n
675,672,text,"This allows you to apply the glue correctly on the surface of the blade and rubber. Then when it dries, it is essential to use either a roller or by hand to properly distribute the rubber on the blade to keep the surface smooth and clean.",n

684,6,h3,Towel,y
686,6,p,"In our opinion, a table tennis towel is one of the essential accessories because players sweat a lot during the game, especially those on a professional level. During training, wear a towel every time. So, between exercises, use it to wipe yourself, and along the way, it is an excellent way to take a break.",n

691,687,text,"The towel is essential for one special reason when it comes to matches. According to the rules of the ITTF , for every 6 points, you have the right to use the towel and take a short break.",n
696,6,p,"Many players, and I will tell you that from experience, almost everyone does it. The reason is that even though you may not need a towel at that moment, you gain precious moments to think about the next point. It can also be an excellent tactic to stop an opponent if he makes an extensive series of points in a row.",n
698,6,h3,Water Bottles,y
699,6,p,,n
700,699,text,"This is especially important for players who train a lot and are more prolonged than an hour. Through play, you lose a lot of fluids and",n

703,699,text,". That is why, in our opinion, a water bottle is listed as an addition to the table tennis equipment.",n
705,6,p,"Especially on hot summer days, it is recommended to have a water bottle with you at every training or match. As with towels, drink a little water between sets or between workouts. This will mean a lot to you at the end of the training because you have not lost any fluid from your body. Water bottles are pieces of equipment for every player.",n
707,6,h3,Rubber Cleaners,y
709,6,p,"If you want to keep your table tennis racket as long as possible, it is recommended to have a rubber cleaner. It consists of a rubber foam cleaner and a care sponge.",n
710,6,p,,n
712,710,strong,Occasionally apply foam to the rubber and rub slowly with a sponge to clean it,n
713,710,text,nicely and extend its lifespan. Another thing is that the effect of contact with the ball will last longer if the rubber is carefully and occasionally cleaned.,n
719,6,p,"Rubber cleaners can be found at very affordable prices, and in any case, they help maintain the racket. Consider this only as an addition to your equipment if you have invested a lot in your racket, so it would be wrong not to clean and maintain it.",n

734,6,p,"There are many types of table tennis bags. Firstly, from smaller ones for training to large ones where you carry a lot of equipment. Secondly, the prices are very affordable, so we recommend each player to have at least one bag that they will keep only for table tennis.",n
736,6,h3,Ball Holder,y
738,6,p,"This is unnecessary, but it is nice when the players keep their balls in the holder. The same goes for a bag because the balls are wet or mixed in a bag with a t-shirt and shoes. After that, it may not have the same effect when playing.",n
739,6,p,,n
741,739,strong,They will last longer and always be clean if you put them in the ball holder after each training.,n
742,739,text,"There is another type of holder, and that is the ball box. It keeps the balls at the height of the table and next to the table while you play.",n
744,6,p,This is especially important for coaches but also for players in training. Then you don’t have to collect one ball at a time every moment. Hold several balls in the ball box and train the exercise at full speed until you have used up all the balls.,n
