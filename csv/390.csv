103,97,p,,n
104,103,text,"The answer is yes and no. It depends on the niche that you serve. If you're 3D printing for the general consumer, then your profit margin might not be high because it's for personal use. Consumers",n

138,97,p,Let's dive right in!,n
141,97,h3,Sell pre-made 3D prints on Etsy,n
144,97,p,"Etsy is one of the biggest marketplace for 3D printing. A lot of 3D printing hobbyists and even professional gravitate towards Etsy because of its large audience who are into handcrafted stuff. Some of them have even made a name for themselves on Etsy, whether that's selling pre-made items with a little bit of customization or selling full on 3D printed objects.",n
146,97,p,"When we were starting out back in 2016, we were the first ones to start selling 3D printed planters. Made boatloads of money but ultimately had to stop because of copyright issues. But also partly, because it wasn't where we imagined company .",n

299,97,p,We'll start off by saying that starting a 3D printing business is the most difficult thing to do out of all the other ideas on this list.,n

333,317,li,"Hard to compete with the giants such as Shapeways, 3DHubs, etc.",n
335,97,p,"We were fortunate that we were located in NYC, where there is huge demand for 3D printing, and that we started in the early days when 3D printing was still new.",n
337,97,p,"We're not saying this because we don't want you to compete with us, but we're saying this because we want you to know the risks involved in the 3D printing business. Many 3D printing companies have gone out of business because they could not make a sustainable profit to keep the lights on.",n
339,97,p,"The amount of work that you have to put in on fulfilling custom orders is a lot. If you don't opt for an automated system, you end up doing a lot of back and forth with clients. And if you do opt in for these instant quoting systems, you can get a lot of low end jobs and lose out on clients with a very custom need.",n
341,97,p,"The real money in offering a 3D printing service, especially if your a small business, is if you can differentiate yourself from merely becoming a commodity.",n
343,97,p,"For us, we had to become more than just a 3D printing service. It sounds corny, but that was the reality. We had to offer other services that would add value to 3D printing. For example, a marketing agency came to us for 3D printed trophy in 24k gold. But we know that we can't 3D print gold. We can either tell them to take it to a metal plating shop or we can do it ourselves and charge on top of it.",n
345,97,p,We can charge a lot more because,n
346,97,ol,,n
349,346,li,"We're taking all the risk. If that metal plating fails, we have to 3D print again.",n
352,346,li,We're making their lives so much easier by being an expert at this field.,n
355,346,li,"And if they're on a really tight deadline, we can charge even more because we're guaranteeing results.",n
357,97,p,Clients who care more about their time and results are willing to pay you a lot if you can deliver.,n
359,97,p,So we've partnered with a local metal plating company and later on started offering metal plating services for 3D printing.,n
361,97,p,Having capabilities more than 3D printing will allow you to charge more than just the 3D print by itself.,n
363,97,p,"Whether that's painting, or creating molds. Whatever it is, you need to find the right clients.",n
366,97,h3,Bonus,n
368,97,p,"3D scanning and printing services are perfect way to increase money you can make from owning 3D printer. Although this would require buying a 3D scanner, it's a good option to think about when increasing your chances of landing a 3D printing client.",n
372,97,h3,Sell your 3D printing designs,n
375,97,p,Making money with 3D printing isn't only limited to running your 3D printer 24 hours a day. You can also make money from selling 3D models!,n

420,97,p,Here's how it works. People pay you an X amount every month for you to publish 3D models for them.,n
422,97,p,This business model is very popular among the tabletop miniature community.,n
424,97,p,"The above picture is from LordOfThePrint 's Patreon. They're one of the popular designers focused on building 3D designs for tabletop gaming. They currently have 1,933 subscribers as of this writing. Assuming only 5% of that is merchants, that's $3,866 of monthly recurring revenue!",n
430,97,p,Take this WallStreetBets 3D model by ChaosCoreTech for example. We spent $50 to have the rights to sell their design for a month. Imagine having 10 Etsy sellers wanting to sell your 3D model. That's have $500 of passive income every month for a few hours of design work!,n
