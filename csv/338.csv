139,119,p,"Priming your face for whatever is going on top is a great way to create the perfect canvas for your makeup. There are several types of primer that you can choose depending on your skin, but we're here to let you in on a little secret: good skincare is just as effective at priming the skin as some primers are. ""Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream tones down redness, plumps skin, and improves skin texture for makeup application or wear,"" says Mackay, ""and for non-wearers, too"" Whether you're concerned about pores, redness, or anti-aging, there's a primer option for everybody. Whitfield swears by Weleda Skinfood Light . ""It effortlessly creates a healthy glow, no matter how much product you pile on,"" she says.",n

179,151,p,"""I recommend applying foundation with a sponge or at least going back with your sponge to really press in the foundation to the skin,"" says Mackay. ""It ensures that it will last longer on the skin and won’t transfer as easily as it would if applied with a brush. Plus, it can look much more natural.""",n

245,225,p,"Your eyebrows are one of the most important features on your face, but many over time have over-plucked, waxed, or have experienced thinning hair, all causes that create a less fuller looking eyebrow. With a pencil, you can easily shape the arch and fill in with light strokes to create a hair-like appearance. Whitfield swears by British brand Eyebrow Queen. ""These are a holy grail. They give such a good payoff with a fine point. The spoolie is precise and thin."" Mackay also recommends products from Fenty Beauty or Benefit Cosmetics for their excellent shade ranges and precision.",n

"" dry down quickly, so don't mistake them for a kohl or an eyeshadow base, unless they're blended immediately,"" warns Whitfield.

There are mechanical, clamp-styled, and heated, mini-curling-iron types; the lift a good curl provides makes a huge difference in making the eye appear bigger and more open, whether or not you're going to put mascara on top.

402,382,p,"Modern setting powders aren't your talc-filled dust that your grandma used to beat on with a powder puff —it's been around since the beginning for a reason). Using a setting powder can help lock liquid products into place, extending wear, smoothing texture, and, in some cases, like Whitfield's favorite pick, Diorskin Forever and Ever loose powder, controls oil. ""This powder blots oil well for all skin tones,"" she says. Mackay likes Fenty Beauty's Pro Filt'r Instant Retouch Setting Powder for both the finish and the sheer amount of powdery goodness you get in one package.",n
410,382,p,"As a general rule, all of your liquid and cream products should be applied before any powder products. Powder on top of cream helps lock things in place; cream on top of powder will cause chunks and separation.",n

It's soft, natural, and comes in various shades for different skin tones."" For an on-the-go option, try a cream stick like Milk Makeup's Mini Lip + Cheek Stick .",n
475,448,p,"Speaking of on-the-go, there are a few things that Whitfield and Mackay agree should be in any going-out clutch or party purse: lip balm for hydration and a sheen of highlight in a pinch, q-tips for easy cleanup, and some lip product: pencil, lip color, or put your cream cheek product on double-duty.",n

""You can thin them out if you want, or if you want a galactic highlight, use them as-is,"" she instructs. Powders like Becca Cosmetics' Shimmering Skin Perfector may seem counterintuitive—a powder, glowy?— but it ""can look dewy with a hydrating mist,"" promises Mackay.",n

Especially for eye products, brushes provide precision that your fingers cannot. The basics include a flat, stiff brush for packing on the product; a fluffy brush for blending and soft washes of color; and a smaller, more detailed brush, like an angled or pencil style, for precision work. And one unusual tool Whitfield calls her secret weapon for mascara? ""A mini eye fan brush,"" she reveals. "" the only thing that gets close to the root of the lash, and it's incredible for blending falsies and for bottom lashes.""
