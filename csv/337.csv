385,4,h5,What makeup products does every beginner need,n
387,4,p,"Lipstick, Lipgloss, Lip liner",y
395,4,h4,Primer,y
397,4,p,Primer preps the skin,n
399,4,p,"It comes in a variety of finishes based on skin type and skin concern, and can make a huge difference in how long your makeup lasts and how your skin looks.",n
405,4,h5,Beginner Makeup Kit Recommendation,n
407,4,p,My personal favorite at the drugstore makeup primer is the Maybelline Master Prime .,n
411,4,p,It comes in 5 different finishes to address your skin’s specific needs and my personal favorites are the Blur + Smooth Primer and the Hydrate + Smooth one .,n
424,4,h4,Foundation,y
426,4,p,Foundation evens out skin tone,n
428,4,p,"Finding your right foundation shade can often be tricky, but thankfully there are several easy tricks for finding your perfect shade.",n
433,4,p,How to Find Your Shade,n
435,4,p,"If you’re a foundation newbie, I recommend going in-store to Ulta and using one of their test samples to swatch the product on your jawline.",n
437,4,p,"Shades also have undertones to them now, so make sure to take that into consideration when selecting a foundation to try.",n
439,4,p,"If your natural skin color has hints of blue, pinks, or red you’re a cool undertone, hints of yellow or gold is a warm undertone, or a mixture of both is a neutral undertone.",n
442,4,p,"On the other hand, if you’ve already found your perfect foundation shade in one brand and would like to try another, the site findation.com is super helpful in determining your shade. I love using it when I’m ordering new products online.",n
451,4,p,L’Oréal Pro Glow or L’Oréal Pro Matte Foundation are my absolute favorite drugstore foundations!,n
457,4,p,these foundations are long-lasting and give such a beautiful finish on the skin.,n
459,4,p,"The Pro Glow is my favorite for the spring and summer in giving a nice dewy finish, while the Pro Matte foundation is perfect if you’re looking for a full-coverage, smooth finish.",n
473,4,h4,Concealer,y
475,4,p,"Concealer covers and conceals dark circles, redness, blemishes, and brightens the under-eye area.",n
477,4,p,It can be worn alone or applied over foundation,n
479,4,p,"As with foundation, keep your skin type in mind when choosing and applying concealer. Also the thicker the product, the less you’ll need to apply.",n
487,4,p,"There’s actually quite a few concealers at the drugstore that I LOVE including the Makeup Revolution Conceal and Define and wet n’ wild Photo Focus Concealer , but for best all around I’d have to go with the e.l.f. Hydrating Camo Concealer .",n
495,4,p,"This amazing full-coverage concealer replaced my long time ride or die Tarte Shape Tape, and is SO affordable at just $6.",n
498,4,p,It’s also not overly drying under the eyes like Shape Tape can be and they have an incredible shade range so you can find your perfect match.,n
500,4,p,Shop at Amazon | Shop at Ulta | Shop at Target,n
507,4,h4,Setting Spray or Setting Powder,y
509,4,p,"To help your makeup look last all day long and stay in place, it’s important to use a setting spray and or or setting powder.",n
512,4,p,"Setting powders are mostly used for the undereye area, but can also be used in areas that are prone for getting oily like the t-zone.",n
514,4,p,Setting sprays can also help give your skin a more matte or dewy finish.,n
521,4,p,NYX Matte Finish Setting Spray or NYX Dewy Finish Setting Spray,n
526,4,p,These setting sprays are my favorite at the drugstore because they not only lock in my makeup look all day but they also help give my skin that perfect matte or dewy finish I’m looking for.,n
528,4,p,these in my makeup collection and usually alternate between the seasons.,n
534,4,p,Makeup Revolution Loose Baking Powder,n
536,4,p,For a setting powder this one is my absolute favorite and it does a great job of setting everything in place without drying out the under eye area.,n
538,4,p,I love using the banana shade under the eye and translucent shade on the face and I always apply it with this amazing $5 brush from Real Techniques.,n
550,4,h4,Blush,y
552,4,p,Blush is the perfect makeup product,n
554,4,p,"Pinks and peaches tend to be most complementary on fair to medium skin tones, while deeper skin tones look great wearing mauves and berry shades.",n
556,4,p,Check out my 10 Best Drugstore Blushes Under $10,n
566,4,p,Milani Baked Blushes are hands down THE BEST drugstore blush and I love them SO much I reviewed and swatched the best Milani Blush shades over here .,n
571,4,p,There is honestly no other way to describe these blushes then – STUNNING.,n
574,4,p,"They have these pretty little flecks of shimmer in them and every single shade looks gorgeous on all skin tones. Berry Amore and Luminoso are my faves, but you can’t go wrong with any of them.",n
583,4,h4,Highlighter,y
586,4,p,"Highlighter adds that perfect, pretty glow to the skin and it’s actually one of my favorite makeup products to use.",n

590,4,p,Check out my 10 Best Drugstore Highlighters Under $15 here .,n
600,4,p,wet n’ wild MegaGlo Highlighting Powder is my top recommendation!,n
603,4,p,At less than $5 each I’m always shook at how good these highlighters are but they’re my #1 recommendation at the drugstore when it comes to highlighters.,n
605,4,p,They add a beautiful shimmer to the skin and are just as good than some higher end highlighters I’ve tried.,n
615,4,h4,Bronzer,y
617,4,p,Bronzer add color and definition to the face and is an easy way to look more refreshed on days when you’re tired.,n
619,4,p,With the right sculpting brush like this one you can also use bronzer to sculpt out and contour the face.,n
627,4,p,Physicians Formula Murumuru Butter Bronzer is truly the only bronzer you’ll ever need !,n
630,4,p,"In case you’ve been living under a rock, I’ll say it for the millionth time- PF Butter Bronzers are THE BEST bronzers EVER!",n
633,4,p,"They smell like a coconut dream, add a beautiful sun-kissed color to the skin, and are SO easy to blend.",n
635,4,p,"Oh and once you buy it, you’ll never want to buy another bronzer",n
644,4,h4,Eyeshadow,y
647,4,p,Eyeshadow is probably the most important item to have in your makeup collection.,n
649,4,p,A good eyeshadow palette with both matte and shimmer shades will help you create beautiful eye looks and will be cheaper than buying separate eyeshadow colors.,n
651,4,p,It’s always a good tip to get an eyeshadow palette that has a range of both neutral shades and colors for versatility.,n
653,4,p,Check out my 8 Best Neutral Eyeshadow Palettes over here.,n
663,4,p,My absolute favorite drugstore eyeshadow palette is hands-down the BH Cosmetics Hangin in Hawaii Palette .,n

714,4,p,"I love purchasing this set that comes with face sponges, mini sponges , and a sculpting sponge for contour or highlight.",n
719,4,h4,Eyelash Curler,y
721,4,p,"I’ll admit I used to be anti eyelash curler, but once I found a great one that’s easy to use, I’ll never go back to not using one.",n
724,4,p,I definitely recommend using one if your eyelashes are naturally straight and don’t hold curl well with mascara alone.,n
731,4,p,my most favorite Amazon purchases EVER.,n
735,4,p,"I’ve tried so many traditional eyelash curlers that didn’t work well or would pinch my skin, but this one is amazing and is as easy as applying mascara.",n
737,4,p,Shop on Amazon,n
740,4,h4,Mascara,y

752,4,p,"If you’re looking for lengthening mascaras, check out my 6 Best Drugstore Mascaras for Long Lashes but two mascaras every beginner needs is L’Oréal Telescopic Mascara and Essence Lash Princess False Lash Effect Mascara",n
760,4,p,"The L’Oréal Telescopic Mascara is THE best when it comes to lengthening and separating the lashes and Essence Lash Princess False Lash Effect Mascara is hands down the best at creating long, feathery looking lashes.",n
766,4,p,I’ve been using both of these mascaras religiously for years and years and can’t say enough good things about them.,n
768,4,p,If you’re more about volume the L’Oréal Paradise Mascara is amazing and is a total dupe for the Too Faced Better Than Sex Mascara.,n
773,4,p,"I also 110% recommend using the L’Oréal Voluminous Lash Primer to create really thick, beautiful lashes.",n
778,4,h4,Eyeliner,y
780,4,p,Eyeliner can be applied to the eyelid to create a dramatic winged look or worn on the inner rim of the eyes to create a more sultry eye look.,n
783,4,p,"There are several different types to choose from including liquid eyeliner, cream eyeliner, and gel, with a cream or gel eyeliner being the most easy to work with.",n
790,4,p,"When first learning how to apply eyeliner, I recommend the Maybelline Lasting Drama Gel Eyeliner.",n
794,4,p,"A gel pot eyeliner and an eyeliner brush are going to be a lot easier to work with in the beginning, as it will give you more control.",n
796,4,p,"For the best winged liner looks, I wholeheartedly recommend the NYX Epic Ink Eyeliner .",n
800,4,p,It’s just as good as high end eyeliners I’ve tried and has amazing staying power.,n
810,4,h4,Eyebrow Pencil,y
812,4,p,A good eyebrow pencil helps define out the brows to help you look more put together- even on makeup free days.,n
814,4,p,"There are several brow products on the market including gels, pomade, and creams, but an eyebrow pencil is always the easiest place to start as a makeup beginner.",n
822,4,p,Hands down the best affordable eyebrow pencil is the NYX Microbrow Pencil .,n
826,4,p,"It’s a total dupe for the Anastasia Beverly Hills eyebrow pencil at a fraction of the cost, and does a great job of defining and shaping the eyebrows.",n
836,4,h4,Lips,y
838,4,p,"Lipstick is my personal favorite makeup product and even worn alone, a little pop of color on the lips can go along way in brightening up the face.",n
840,4,p,"Even better, there are several types of lip products available nowadays including lipstick, lipgloss, liquid lipstick, and tinted lip balms.",n
848,4,p,"The options for a great, affordable lipstick are endless, but my two all-around favorites are the Essence Stay 8 Hour Matte Liquid Lipsticks and Maybelline Color Sensational Creamy Matte Lipsticks .",n
