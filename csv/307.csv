211,194,p,"Peace lilies are known as some of the best plants for beginners, as they’re easy to care for and give plenty of visual clues about their needs. To care for peace lilies, you’ll want to water once a week or so. However, if you forget, the plant will wilt dramatically to let you know it’s thirsty and perk right back up again after. It can tolerate low-light environments, but you’re more likely to get those lovely white blooms if it’s in medium to bright indirect light.",n

It requires several hours of bright, indirect light per day and should be kept away from drafty areas. This plant is also sensitive to over-watering, so be sure to check its soil moisture before giving it a drink.",n
645,64,h2,How To Care For Indoor Plants,n
647,64,p,"Most experts I spoke with began with the same basic mantra: Light is food for plants. “Fertilizer offers extra nutrients and water helps, but your plant needs light to survive,” says Marino. She suggests standing near the window in your house or apartment around noon and noticing how hot and bright it feels. “You should be able to estimate if your apartment is relatively low light, medium light or high light at midday,” she explains. Assessing your home’s light situations serves as a guide for which plants you should choose to populate your sill .",n
649,64,p,"“We think of plant buying a bit like matchmaking,” says Blank. We want your plants to fit your home, your style and your lifestyle.” Set yourself up for success by starting with low-maintenance plant varieties, like a marble queen pothos or ZZ plant , that can withstand a little accidental neglect while you travel up the learning curve.",n
655,64,p,"Plants need good care in order to thrive, but new plant parents have the tendency to over-care for their plants. “Over-watering is the easiest way to kill your plant,” says Blank. “It’s easier to bounce back from under-watering than from over-watering.” Marino adds, “some people go into diagnosis mode the second they see a browning tip or yellowing leaf.” Her advice: don’t panic. “Just prune it right off and know that shedding is a natural part of the growth process.”",n
657,64,p,"Christan Summers, CEO and co-founder of Tula Plants and Design , advises against repotting plants too frequently. Some plant owners see a plant growing well and think that’s the time to switch it into a roomier pot. But that well-meaning impulse can backfire. “Repotting disrupts the plant’s root system, which means it has to focus on reestablishing its system instead of on new growth. You’re making it work harder than it needs to,” she says. Instead let your plants thrive in their current pots. “When you’re getting absolutely no growth—especially in spring and summer—then it is time,” Summers says.",n
661,64,p,"Just because some plants don’t need frequent watering doesn’t mean you should forget about them for too long. Take some time each day to touch base with your plant babies. “Developing a routine and ritual is important,” says Oakes. “If you get up to check on your plants when your coffee is brewing or tea is steeping, then you’re on the right path.”",n
663,64,p,"From YouTube and gardening books, to walking into a shop and chatting up the staff, there are endless sources to continue educating yourself about the houseplants in your life. For those who can’t make it to a store, Tula offers robust educational resources like a plant care library . The Sill offers online workshops that answer burning plant care questions. And Oakes recently launched a 12-part mini course called Houseplant Basics that teaches the fundamentals of plant care.",n

697,64,h3,Where Should I Put My Houseplants Indoors?,n
699,64,p,"The best place for your house plant depends on the plant, but getting that info isn’t hard. Just search the name of your plant to find out if it will be happiest in direct sunlight, indirect sunlight or lower light. Then assess your space for sunlight, what direction your windows face and the average temperature and humidity. Most plants do well in light from windows facing west, east or south in rooms that are around 70 degrees Fahrenheit. However there are plenty of exceptions—for example, plants from tropical regions like it hot and humid, while plants with big, thick leaves are healthiest with a good amount of shade.",n
