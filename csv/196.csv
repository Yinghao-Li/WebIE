664,3,p,How well in advance should I contact my roommate?,n
666,3,p,"Contact your roommate to decide who will bring what about three months in advance. Given the small size of typical college dorms, you can bet there won’t be much space for bringing unnecessary items. If possible, split necessities with your roommate. This way you won’t end up with two TVs, two lounge chairs or two futons. If you’re interested in coordinating your linens and decor with your roommate, be sure to decide on a reasonable budget together.",n
669,3,p,What are my moving choices?,n
671,3,p,"Moving to a college dorm is typically a small move . A few options include driving yourself, having your parents drive you, and booking a truck rental or trailer . Those who need their cars on campus should drive themselves. If the car lacks enough space, consider renting a trailer. If you’re moving with only a few boxes and necessities, then you can probably skip the truck rental. Maybe three’s a friend or a family member who has a pickup truck and can do you a favor. After considering the pros and cons of each moving method, pick the one that best fits your needs and budget.",n
682,3,p,When should I start packing?,n
684,3,p,"About a month before your moving date, it’s time to start packing up your things . Remember that not everything will be allowed on campus. Be sure to double-check the housing department’s policy on prohibited and hazardous dorm room items. In addition, place all important items, such as passports and IDs, in a separate, clearly labeled box or folder. This will prevent them from getting lost during the moving process.",n
689,3,p,my belongings when I leave,n
691,3,p,"Dorms typically close for big holidays like spring break, Thanksgiving and Christmas. If you plan to return you can leave your belongings in your dorm room, though of course don’t leave any perishables or valuables unattended.",n

699,3,p,How long does it take to move into a dorm room?,n
701,3,p,"On average, it will take between 1.5 and 3 hours to move into a college dorm. Expect 15-30 minutes for check-in, 15-30 minutes for cleaning and sanitizing your dorm room, 30 minutes to 1 hour of unloading and moving your stuff into your room, and 30 minutes to 1 hour for unpacking and organizing.",n
704,3,h2,Moving into a dorm soon?,n
706,3,p,"Chances are, you’ll need to move a lot more than you anticipate. From clothes and bedding to personal items and more, your college essentials can quickly exceed what your car can hold. Fortunately, you can rent small trucks and trailers to get your stuff to school, plus the labor to help pack and unpack . Good luck and happy moving!",n
