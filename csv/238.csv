168,161,span,"While there are many acceptable options from which to choose, the Boss B16216 Mesh Drafting Stool with adjustable seat and with or without arms is recommended. In addition, we recommend that you purchase a set of soft rubber caster wheels as the hard casters standard on this type of chair will not effectively grip the polished concrete floors in the new building. Of course you DO NOT need to purchase this particular chair but do remember that you will be using this for the next 4 to 5 years and comfort and durability are key. Students are encouraged to use a cable lock to secure their stool to their assigned desk. During the semester, students usually leave their supplies and stools locked up in studio as we encourage you to do most if not all your studio work in the studio.",n
