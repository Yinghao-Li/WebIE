103,98,h2,SKETCH PAD,y
104,98,p,,n
105,104,text,An essential part of being a hand lettering artist and calligrapher is to carry a sketch pad at all times. You never know when inspiration may strike! My favorite sketch pad for hand lettering is,n
107,104,strong,"Strathmore's 9x12"" sketch pad",n
108,104,text,", as well as the smaller versions that I carry with me. The paper itself is awesome - it's nice and smooth, not rough or porous, so it won't dry out your pens! It's also thick enough to use",n

113,112,text,"For a calligraphy sketch pad, I LOVE the",n
115,112,strong,Borden and Riley #234 Paris Paper,n
116,112,text,". This pad of paper helped me seriously take a step forward in my calligraphy practice - it is so smooth, so my nibs never get caught on the paper, and the ink doesn't bleed at all, which is huge.",n
119,98,h2,PENCILS,y
120,98,p,,n
121,120,text,"Another necessity for hand lettering artists and calligraphers are pencils. When I have an idea for a piece, I like to use pencil to layout a rough sketch first. I will then refine the sketch later in pencil again, which I will then trace with ink. You rarely get a sketch right the first time, so pencils are a MUST so that you can erase and edit as you go. There is something very comforting about using a pencil, knowing that you idea is not permanent and is able to be adjusted as needed. I've purchased more expensive pencils before, but I always go back to just",n

127,98,h2,ERASERS,y
128,98,p,,n
129,128,text,"Along with those mechanical pencils, I highly suggest a good eraser to prevent smudges. Sometimes the erases on mechanical pencils aren't very great, so I like to buy a better eraser that is all on its own. My favorite is the",n
131,128,strong,Staedtler Mars Plastic Eraser,n
132,128,text,"- this eraser is seriously amazing, and has never failed me. I used to grab those pink erasers I used in grade school, but quickly learned that they leave smudges and ugly marks on my work - gross! The Staedtler eraser doesn't do that - it is colorless and super soft, so all of my work ends up being smudge-free!",n

144,141,strong,Calligraphic Practice Paper by Bienfang,n
145,141,text,". It's a great pad of paper that you can get from pretty much any art supply store! The paper is thick enough that your ink won't bleed through, and it's also smooth enough that your nibs won't get caught as you're writing.",n

153,149,strong,HP Laserjet Premium Paper,n
154,149,text,". It is seriously the best! The colors always come out crisp and bright, and I also love to use it to practice my calligraphy, as the paper is so smooth and the ink doesn't bleed one bit. It's always nice to have loose leaf paper around, and this is by far my favorite.",n
157,98,h2,TRACING PAPER,y
158,98,p,,n
159,158,text,Tracing paper is another must in my business. My favorite is the,n
161,158,strong,"Canson Tracing Paper 9x12"" pad",n
162,158,text,". I use it for a lot of my pens, as it doesn't dry them out, and it's obviously great for tracing over my pencil sketches.",n
165,98,h2,MICRON PENS,y
166,98,p,,n
168,166,strong,Pigma Micron Pens,n
169,166,text,"are the best pens I've found for inking over my pencil sketches. You can buy them in a bunch of different line weights, as well as different colors. I almost always stick to black, as that is that color I prefer to scan my hand lettering pieces in, but feel free to experiment! These pens are seriously awesome.",n

176,173,strong,straight nib holder,n
177,173,text,or an,n
179,173,strong,oblique nib holder,n
180,173,text,". I used to write with a straight nib holder, but I tried out an oblique nib holder recently and haven't looked back! It's really all about preference, although I feel like I have so much more control with the oblique holder and can get great angles that I can't really achieve with the straight holder. I'll be covering how to use each of these holders in a later lesson, so stay tuned!",n

187,184,strong,Zebra G nib,n
188,184,text,". It writes super smooth, and is great for beginners as they learn when and where to apply pressure in calligraphy. They are also super long-lasting, have amazing flexibility and write well in all directions. Other nibs I really love are the",n

199,198,text,Using the right ink,n
201,198,strong,black Sumi Ink,n
202,198,text,"- it is the best I've tried, and I've tried LOTS. This ink doesn't smear, it dries quickly, has a beautiful, glossy finish and an amazing consistency.",n
205,98,h2,OTHER CALLIGRAPHY INKS,y
206,98,p,,n
207,206,text,my favorites are,n
209,206,strong,Dr. Ph. Martin's Bleedproof White Ink,n
210,206,text,and,n
212,206,strong,Dr. Ph. Martin's Copperplate Gold Ink,n
213,206,text,". One of the most requested ink colors is gold, as Dr. Ph. Martin's is always my go-to. For white ink, Dr. Ph. Martin's is also the best bet, as it is completely opaque white. The only downsides to these two inks are that you constantly have to stir the gold ink, and the white ink has to be watered down A LOT before it can be used. However, they are seriously the best out there.",n

228,225,strong,Tombow Dual Brush Pens,n
229,225,text,". The pens have two different options on each end - a flexible brush tip on one end, and a fine point on the other end. There are an endless amount of colors you can get these things in, and as long as they are used on the correct paper, they last a really long time.",n
