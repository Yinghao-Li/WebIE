144,142,p,"There aren't any big secrets about Leatherworking, but the craft can be a bit overwhelming to dive into in the beginning. I asked a Leatherworker I looked up to about getting into the craft, and he gave me great piece of advice. He told me not to buy a beginner's starter leather tool kit because I'd probably end up with a bunch of tools I won't use. He then said to ""let the project you want to do, dictate the tools you need."" This is fantastic advice, but what tools do I buy ?!",n

152,151,text,"The options for leather working tools are pretty limitless and there are lots of leather starter kits out there that leave a lot to be desired. It didn't seem like that at first, but the more reading I did online about working with leather, the more tools I discovered. In the beginning of any hobby one gets into, there's always a startup cost. A balance needs to be struck between buying enough tools to get started, and not spending too much in case it doesn't work out. That caution about overspending in the beginning can lead to buying cheaper version of tools that will most certainly need to be replaced at some point in order to move forward with the craft. My favorite example of this was a Diamond Shaped Awl Blade from Tandy Leather Factory. Don't get me wrong, Tandy has a lot of good stuff, and the fact that they're so accessible and convenient helps out a lot in the beginning. I got a fantastic book from Tandy to get me started called """,n
154,151,strong,Hand Sewing Leather,n
155,151,text,""" by Al Stohlman. Stohlman recommended getting an Awl Haft , and a diamond shaped Awl Blade. Tandy has both of those things! Perfect! I placed my first order with Tandy that included a giant side of vegetable tanned leather , waxed linen thread, needles, an awl haft and a diamond shaped blade. I was well on my way and so excited about it. Into the haft the blade went, and ready to poke some holes! No leather was safe! Not so fast. I had no idea how hard it was to poke holes in leather. I went online and found out that my Tandy blade needed to be sharpened in order to effectively do its job. I have a Tri-Stone sharpener for my kitchen knives, and began grinding it down so that all four sides of the blade were sharp and smooth, and the tip came to fine, sharp point. Ahh.....Now we're in business. My hand stitching improved dramatically now that I could get through the leather, and the two hours I spent sharpening that blade were really worth it . After some extended use, the tip of the blade started to bend, and I had to bend it back to keep stitching. It started happening more regularly, and I started looking into other options. I came upon a Leatherworking forum online, and one of the members mentioned how great the Douglas Tools blades were from Sheridan Leather . At $27 or each, they'd better be good because my $8 blade that I spent 2 hours sharpening was pretty good..... wait. I plunked down the $27 for one blade, and my World of Leather was forever changed. That new blade glided through the leather with ease, and it went through many layers as if they were one. I've been using the same blade now for 4 years, and I think it's safe to say I got my money's worth.",n

716,710,p,"I can't imagine there's much difference between any of the presses. I happen to have the one from Buckleguy because it's easy to pair up their dies with the grommets they sell. I must admit that I started out with hand setters, and there's just no comparison to having a press. I had a batch of snaps that wouldn't cooperate at all with the hand setters, but they're rock-solid with the press. The wallet I just posted on instagram was one of those hand-set snaps that ultimately failed. I repaired it a couple days ago with my press, and it's good as new . You really can't go wrong with Campbel-Randall either. They make seriously great stuff. I don't have experience with presses other than my own, but I'm pretty sure that all of the dies are proprietary, so it probably becomes a situation where you have to pick one and commit to it, but I don't know that for sure. Thanks for letting me know about the press being unavailable. I'll try to update that link.",n

1286,1279,br,LEATHER,n
1288,1279,br,I’m beginning to understand that after investment in tools and the hours and hours put into a project it doesn’t make a lot of sense to scrimp on the leather!,n
1290,1279,br,While my project is a relatively small I would like a very firm backside that will still allow me to do an inside- out construction. I think 8-10oz Hermann Oak or a latigo or bridle leather. What would you,n
1292,1279,br,"As always, I’m in your debt",n
1324,558,div,,n
1328,1324,p,The VB irons make little slits instead of diamond or round holes which make for a very neat stitching appearance.,n
1330,1324,p,"I think a pony is extremely important. It provides the foundation to apply enough leverage to get your needles through the holes, and frees up your hands to work freely. You won't be able to use your pony for the entire bag construction, but it will help with getting most of the panels put together. I've only ever used a standard under-the-leg pony and my custom one. I don't have plans for the custom one, but I'd be happy to share pictures of it with you and discuss its dimensions. It's a floor model with a 30"" throat.",n
1332,1324,p,"Go for solid copper rivets. They're relatively easy to work with and they're quite strong. 1"" length should be great for 99% of your projects because as you mentioned, the excess gets snipped off.",n
1334,1324,p,"Wickett and Craig, Hermann Oak. and Horween are the biggest names, but there are definitely other great tanneries out there as well. I like buying from the bigger tanneries because I know I'm getting a consistent, quality product that will be the same today as it will be in fifteen years when I order it again. When you start building your bag, you'll quickly learn that mixing leathers doesn't really work well for the overall appearance and construction unless the leathers are similar. The bag will hang oddly, stitch weirdly, and will be inconsistent with the rest of the bag. If you mix leathers, make sure to use leathers with similar tempers and hand .",n

1376,1370,p,Brilliant idea to use line 24 snaps for an easily replaceable shearling pad. Of course it requires yet another tool but thanks for the design idea. What size hole punch do I need to set those snaps?,n
1378,1370,p,"Can you give me an overview of thread sizes - you said you typically used .035 or 1mm, but what is the heaviest weight for a backpack project? I have a number 2 BK groover ordered, should I also get a #3 blade for the heaviest thread. Is the Ritza, the Maine thread or the fil au chinois better for a larger project? Realizing that it's a matter of personal preference, everything I see that I like seems to have contrasting stitching - is bright white or an off- white a safer place to start?",n
1380,1370,p,"Similarly, what size hole punch do I need",n
1382,1370,p,Which of the edger sizes work with each weight of leather? For 6 oz leather would I use a #2 edger and for 10 oz leather a #3?,n

1430,1422,p,"The hole size you'll need to punch for line 24 snaps is 3.5mm. For #12 and #14 rivets, you'll need 3mm and 2mm respectively.",n
1432,1422,p,"I would highly recommend sticking with polyester thread. Natural materials can wear down quickly, and are prone to rot. When I first started out, I was using waxed linen thread because I didn't know any better, and the very first belt I ever sold came back across my workbench to be restitched 5 years later because many of the stitches had broken. You can probably go up to 0.040"", but I wouldn't suggest going any thicker than that. That's more than enough to hold your bag together. Remember, it's not the strength of the thread per se, but all of the stitches together as a whole that make the seam strong. I think a Barry King #2 awl blade should be more than enough to get you where you want to go. I use Maine Thread Lark thread when I want a good cream colored contrast, and Maine Thread Goldbrown when I want something complimenting or matching. It's all personal preference.",n
1434,1422,p,"The edger size doesn't necessarily correlate to the thickness of the leather, but you can use that method as a general guide. I happen to love my #2 edger and the edge it produces, so I use it for most of my edges that are heavier than 4 or 5oz. I save my #3 for bag seams, but I still reach for my #2 when I'm making a thick belt because I like the more subtle rounded edge that it creates.",n
1436,1422,p,"The inside out approach will indeed be more forgiving for a beginner because any grave errors will be hidden away inside the bag. If you prefer the look of a bag with the seams on the outside, I would suggest getting some practice in with your stitching before attempting a bag. The keys to success with stitching come down to having a stitching pony, starting out with a straight line from a compass or an edge groover and having straight holes , and making sure your needle placement is the same every time. For me, it's left needle in, on the side of the hole closest to me, right needle in, farthest from me, pull tight. Repeat. It doesn't matter how you do it, but it has to be consistent, or your stitching won't be even.",n

3703,558,div,,n
3705,3703,p,Hi Judith!,n
3707,3703,p,"That's a bit ambitious :) Working with leather is a unique skill set in that you'll learn to manipulate a very strong material to do a job for a long time. Panniers are something that you want to look great and work properly, and unless you have more experience than you're letting on, you might consider making some smaller projects first to get your feet wet. Based on how the first ten of my projects looked I wouldn't want those on my bike forever. You're going to make mistakes, and in leather, everything you do to it is forever. There's no take-backs or mulligans. With very few exceptions , generally the only option if you make a mistake is to start over. Sometimes that means doing a small piece of the project over, and sometimes that means scrapping the entire project.",n
3709,3703,p,"As an introductory project, I would suggest a small wallet. You might consider working up to a small bag like a Dopp kit or a make-up bag before attempting panniers. Bags are fun to make, but require a different skill set than flat projects like wallets.",n

3822,3799,p,Hi - Thanks for this list. I'm wondering why you don't use a chisel that can punch 4 holes at a time? Instead of the awl?,n

3856,3854,p,Hey Chris!,n
3858,3854,p,Glad you found it useful.,n
3860,3854,p,"To answer your question, I do use a chisel or pricking irons for thinner leather. I started out working with leather with only an awl though, and I still believe it's an important skill to learn first. What I like about a multi-hole chisel is the speed in which I can punch holes. What I don't like is the blind side of the leather because I have no idea what's going on there until I punch through and look. It takes some practice to make sure your chisel goes exactly where you want it, and that's a huge disadvantage. When I use an awl, it goes exactly where I want it to go, and it's always straight. I use chisels for 99% of my work now, but when I do a large piece like a bag, thick leather where a chisel would reach its terminal depth, or expensive leather like Shell Cordovan, I always reach for my awl. To me, it's important to know how to use the basic tools before moving onto the tools that make things ""easier.""",n
