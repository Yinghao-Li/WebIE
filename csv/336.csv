42,7,div,,n
44,42,p,"You know you want to devote your career and artistic abilities to becoming a makeup artist, but how to start?",n
46,42,p,"The first thing you need is the proper makeup kit. Your makeup supply essentials depend on two factors: the kind of clients you plan to work with, and state licensing requirements you may have to meet to work professionally.",n
48,42,p,Before you know it you could be the next Rolf Keppler. He was on the makeup team for Twilight as well as Terminator Salvation and the TV series ER .,n
56,42,p,Or what about Vivian Orgill. She didn’t do the makeup for just any old nuptial agreement; she was the key makeup artist for My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 .,n
60,42,p,"Maybe you’ll follow in the vein of Dunia Rivero. She runs her own makeup business in Miami and specializes in weddings, runway events, and music videos.",n
62,42,p,"Maybe, just maybe, you will be the next Mario Dedivanovic. You know, the man behind Kim Kardashian’s signature look. It all starts with the right supplies in your makeup kit.",n
64,42,h2,What the Pros Have in Their Makeup Kits,n
66,42,p,You’ve been doing your own makeup – and probably your friends’ too – for years so you already have a basic idea of what you need in a makeup kit.

As you gain more experience in this artistic field you are going to learn a lot more about what you’re going to need to pack in your kit.,n
68,42,p,As you develop your own career in this field you can talk to your colleagues to see what they recommend for a general makeup kit. Here is what a few well-known makeup artists advise:,n

173,42,p,"Sanitation, disinfection, hygiene, client protection, and your protection. You must have general supplies that address all of these issues.

202,42,p,The regulations regarding makeup artist licensing vary significantly from state to state. Check with your state’s board of cosmetology to see if you need a license to work as a makeup artist. The requirements for makeup artistry licensure typically fall into one of these categories:,n

213,203,li,"State makeup permit required – Louisiana is currently the only state to offer a specific license or permit for makeup artists, and you are not required to pass an examination for this credential",n
215,42,p,"If you are in a state that requires an esthetician or cosmetology license to work as a makeup artist, that means you’ll need to pass a licensing examination. These examinations typically require you to bring a kit with you to demonstrate your practical abilities. Knowing the general kit content requirements for these exams can therefore help you to plan what materials you want to purchase for your makeup kit.",n
217,42,p,"Once again, check with your state’s board of cosmetology to know the specific kit contents you need for an exam. Cosmetology boards and testing companies usually provide candidate information bulletins that detail the specific kit requirements for your exam.",n
219,42,h2,NIC Esthetician and Cosmetologist Kit Requirements,n
221,42,p,"The National-Interstate Council of State Boards of Cosmetology has developed esthetician and cosmetology exams that are the closest things to a nationalized standard.
