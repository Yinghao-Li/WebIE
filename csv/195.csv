These “guns” were trademarked as soft air guns, tailoring to the needs of shooting enthusiasts while conforming to Firearm and Sword Possession Control Law Japan's strict gun control.

369,18,p,"Airsoft guns spread to the United Kingdom in the late 1980s and early 1990s via a company called LS, and were sold in separate pieces and had to be assembled before they were capable of shooting. These then became available to the rest of Europe and North America and rapidly gained popularity worldwide. Since the mid-1980s, airsoft has been adapted with a purely recreational application in mind, and the sport is enjoyed by all ages. Airsoft replicas are produced globally, with the majority being manufactured in East Asia . Many law enforcement agencies and military units within the United States now use airsoft for force-on-force training drills.",n

419,405,text,"These HPA replicas are most often referred to as ""PolarStars"", although this refers to a popular brand of HPA engines and accessories.",n
421,18,p,"A typical airsoft gun is noticeably lighter than its ""real steel"" counterpart due to the use of aluminum alloy and plastic materials, though some have added weights in them for a more realistic feel. Japan has specific rules about producing airsoft guns with metal parts, while newer guns, especially those made in Taiwan and Mainland China , have both internal and external parts that are metallic. Smoke caps, as well as noise amplifiers, are available for certain airsoft guns to add realism.",n
429,18,p,"Gas handgun magazines usually contain 10 to 30 pellets in a standard-capacity magazine; however, some are high-capacity magazines and can hold 50 rounds or more. In the case of AEG rifles, magazines come in either real-capacity , low-capacity , mid-capacity , or high-capacity . These magazines have spring followers like in BB guns . The high-cap magazines often have a ratchet wheel that can be wound up periodically to force pellets up from the holding chamber of the magazine to the feeding chute. Due to loose pellets in the reservoir, they often make a rattling noise when running or walking. Some airsoft guns have a battery-powered box or drum magazine that holds thousands of pellets, but these are usually only used and allowed on LMGs type replicas.",n

462,461,text,"The ""hop-up"" system, which is installed in most stock airsoft rifles and pistols, is used to increase effective ranges by putting backspin on the pellets. The Magnus effect causes the pellets to experience more lift as they are shot, counteracting against gravity.",n
473,461,text,"A small rubber nub protrudes into the top of the barrel through a small hole, and it catches the top of the pellet as it moves past. Adjusting the hop-up makes the nub more or less protruded into the barrel, so that backspin is increased or reduced. Ideally, the hop-up should be adjusted so that the pellets fly as far as possible in a straight line without curving upward too far or dropping to the ground too quickly. Hop-Up does decrease the muzzle velocity with the hop fully unwound can drop to as low as 300 ft or s ). Ease and location of adjustment vary by gun design; some equipment provides a control that can be adjusted quickly during gameplay, while others may require partial dis-assembly. For example, a common location for Hop-Up adjustment is where the ejection port would be on a real firearm, which allows the machine to be covered while still allowing quick access to adjust the Hop-Up.",n
486,18,p,"Some players customize their airsoft guns, either to improve performance or for purely aesthetic reasons. Additions include scopes, fore-grips, and flashlights, red dot sights being the most commonly used. Red dot sights are used to help aim, fore-grips are used to get a better grip on the airsoft gun, flashlights are used to illuminate dark areas and or or to blind opponents.",n
492,18,p,"Even though in certain countries lasers are illegal, they are popular attachments in the U.S. and Europe. Laser sights are more for their appearance than any practical effect, largely because they must be weak enough not to carry a risk of damaging another player's eyesight, which rules out using any laser powerful enough to produce a visible dot on the target in sunlight .",n

However, the most popular weights for AEGs and GBB* are 0.20 g and 0.25 g to 400 ft or s ). Mid to high end AEGs use 0.20–0.30 g pellets, while heavier rounds are typically used in long range and sniper applications since they are more stable in flight and less easily deflected by wind.",n
521,18,p,"Pellets are usually bought in bags or bottles of 2,000 to 5,000, but other sizes are available, such as a 250,000 round package of tournament grade pellets. Biodegradable pellets are a fraction more expensive than non-bio counterparts, but many fields require them. Pellets are typically 6 mm in diameter, though 8 mm pellets do exist. Pellets vary by diameter depending on the brand . Pellets are used for the majority of play, although foam balls may be used to represent M203 grenade launcher shells.",n

Close Quarter Battle arenas typically regulate velocity on airsoft guns at around 110 m or s . For outdoor fields, velocity is usually regulated by the type of gun. With a standard 0.20 grams pellet, fully automatic Airsoft Electric Guns are often set at less than 120 m or s , semi-automatic DMR -style AEGs at 120–140 m or s , and bolt-action sniper rifles at 140–150 m or s .",n

625,618,text,"The ""sweet spot"" for barrel length in a spring or electric powered airsoft gun is around 450 mm , beyond which added barrel length will not improve accuracy.",n
631,618,text,"In any case, barrel quality, velocity consistency, and hopup quality or design are more important factors with regard to accuracy.",n
637,618,text,"Added barrel length will result in slightly increased velocity if the cylinder size and compression are appropriate for the barrel length. For example, a gun with a large cylinder and a long barrel will shoot slightly harder than a gun with a small cylinder and a short barrel .",n
645,618,text,"This rule will apply even for barrels longer than 500 mm , if there is enough cylinder volume and air compression to propel the pellet through the barrel.",n
651,618,text,"However, the resulting velocity increase will be hardly noticeable. The only considerable advantage of using a longer inner barrel in an AEG or spring-powered gun is that it generally will make the gun quieter due to the weakened muzzle pop .",n
654,18,p,,n
655,654,text,"In gas-powered guns, added barrel length can result in increased velocity and accuracy to a degree. Tighter-bore barrels will increase velocity because there will be less space between the pellet and the barrel for the air to escape through. Most stock airsoft guns have 6.05–6.08 mm bore barrels, but best performance",n
658,654,text,"is usually seen with ""tightbore"" barrels, which are 6.01–6.05 mm in diameter. However, the tighter the bore, the more likely the chance of a pellet jam, and subsequently, tightbores need to be cleaned and lubricated regularly. It is generally agreed upon that a high-quality 6.01-6.02 mm barrel will provide the highest muzzle velocity, while a good-quality 6.03 mm or 6.05 mm barrel will provide the best compromise between power, accuracy and ease of maintenance. The actual accuracy difference between tightbore sizes is debatable and usually outweighed by bore consistency. Although, with the newfound popularity with HPA guns, the debate has been opened that barrels with a larger diameter could provide a more accurate shot. Due to the higher volume of air surrounding the pellet it negates the chance of the pellet coming into contact with the barrel, throwing the pellet's trajectory off, similar to a musket, in how the bullet slams about before leaving the barrel.",n

They are also outfitted with muzzle protectors that amplify the sound to a decibel level comparable to that of a real firearm. The average FPS for professional training airsoft guns is higher than civilian models. Economically, airsoft is cheaper than simulation training. Benjamin Kratz, Fort Jackson's battalion executive officer, said that one blank M16 round can cost as much as 32 airsoft rounds.
