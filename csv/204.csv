199,196,br,"work again after a cheerful, careless voyage.”",n
201,196,br,Mark Twain,n
203,192,p,"At some point early in our paddling lives, perhaps when we find ourselves approaching the end of a long paddling day but still a few miles from the takeout, we get to wondering.",n
205,192,p,"“What if,” we surmise, thoughtfully stroking our stubbled chins, “I didn’t have to go home? What if I had, right here inside my boat, all the stuff I needed to eat and sleep and be comfortable for a night? Maybe two …?”",n
210,192,p,"And so the ancient art of paddle-camping is rediscovered. But be careful; it was exactly this sort of fanciful reasoning that caused many a voyageur and mountain man to head for the woods, never to be seen again.",n
212,192,p,Following are some tips and pointers to help make your own overnight kayak-camping adventures a bit more enjoyable.,n
214,192,h3,Pack Light,n
216,192,p,"If you’ve recently made the transition from car camping, you may wonder where in your kayak to stow the cast-iron Dutch oven, chaise lounge, and beer cooler. Kayak camping is not as restrictive as backpacking, but almost. Even much of your favorite gear that is easily swallowed by a canoe will have to be left behind when kayak camping, so some strict discipline is in order.",n
218,192,h3,Size Matters,n
220,192,p,"You’ll probably find it easier to use lots of smaller drybags instead of a few larger bags, to better adapt to the oddly-shaped interior of most kayaks. Your bags should be color coded for organization, and perhaps even labeled with identifying tags. Heavy vinyl bags are alright for food, as they are more resistant to puncture and probably allow less bear-attracting odor to waft through the woods, but they stubbornly stick to one another when packing into the boat. Most of my favorite bags are instead made of lightweight nylon or polyester fabric with an internal rubberized waterproof coating. Though perhaps requiring a bit more care to prevent punctures, these bags easily slide past one another when jammed into a cargo compartment, making packing more efficient. As you close each drybag, be sure to squeeze out as much air as possible before rolling down the neck seal, to conserve precious space inside your compartments.",n
223,192,p,Fragile essentials and other valuables may require extra padding,n
225,192,h3,Keep Your Balance,n
227,192,p,"Heavier items like food and water should be packed near the middle of your kayak, preferably just behind the rear bulkhead, while lighter, bulky items like sleeping bags and clothing get packed toward the ends. Everything should be packed low and centered from side-to-side, to keep your boat stable and balanced. The only exception to these general rules is if you need to re-trim a boat for better handling. When one of my paddling partner’s skeg cable broke halfway through a trip, he wisely loaded his boat a little stern-heavy the following days, to alleviate weathercocking.",n
230,192,p,"A few days before your first overnighter, try test-packing your kayak to see if all your intended gear will indeed fit. It probably won’t. As you choose items that won’t make the trip, just remind yourself that the whole purpose of kayak camping is to get away from it all.",n
234,192,h3,A Packing List,n
236,192,p,Rev. 13,n
238,192,p,"I offer below my current personal packing list, suitable for multi-day, self-supported sea-kayak trips on the Great Lakes or inland waterways. I am constantly tinkering with this list, as evidenced by the revision number above, and will post new ones here as they evolve.",n
240,192,p,"You will undoubtedly wonder about certain items on my list . So by all means, feel free to add and delete gear to make it your own personal packing list.",n
246,192,p,"Believe it or not, all this stuff fits through the hatches of 14- to 18-foot sea kayaks, though sometimes I wonder how. If you’re paddling with others, there is no need to duplicate some of the equipment such as tents and cookware, but it’s often wise to have a spare stove or water filter, so use your best judgment, and hit the water!",n

575,564,p,"I have Kakak camped on lake islands and the Arkansas River system for the last several years. Looking over this list I see it is fairly close to what has evolved into my camp set up. I would add, underwater sealing epoxy, a roll of duct tape, a roll of light gauge wire cable and a few light shackles. I have a 17 foot sea kayak with a rudder. The Cable and shackles are for repair of rudder cables. The epoxy and duct tape is in case of a breach in the hull. This has never happened as of yet. Still when several miles from land, you kayak is your life raft. Vigilance and preparation is absoluey needful. I have had two aquaintaces who died at sea in central California. One certaninly by shark attack and the other was lost with only his EPIRB and PFD found miles out. I am happiest when on large waters.",n

895,893,p,"I think you are a bit mistaken on the need for smaller bags. The reason for small bags is they will fit through the hatches, not because they are more efficient. If you have a kayak without bulkheads or have decent sized hatches, it is better to use fewer large bags. One large well fitting bag wastes less space than several smaller bags with all the gaps around them. But the big win comes with loading and unloading the boat. Remember tide wait for no person. And sometimes the camp site is a bit of a distance from the kayak haul-up I’d rather bring two or three large bags up than go back and forth for several trips to get small bags.",n
897,893,p,"Now I have one bag for clothes or electronics, one bag for shelter, one bag for food and one for odds and ends.",n
899,893,p,"Sure, you can carry a duffle bag to haul all the little bags to camp in one carry. And you can then use that duffle bag to hang your food bags. Note, though you can suspend your food directly from the dry bag it’s in, those dry bag seams were not designed to hold that kind of weight in the air . But over all, my load or unload times have gotten steadily faster as the number of bags has gotten smaller.",n
901,893,p,"My Kayak is like a station wagon compared to todays boats. I measured the inside hull diameter and bought duffle and top open dry bags that just fit. Much easier to load, easier to find stuff , less chance of leaving things behind .",n
903,893,p,"Think of it like this – the next two times you go to the store, on one trip, use the fewest bags possible; load them up. Now note how long it takes you to load them in the car and take them into the house. On the second trip, give each item category it’s own bag, wine, milk, veggies, boxed items, cans – all in separate bags. Then see how long it takes to load them in the car and take them into the house. I rest my case",n

921,917,p,"Taken by itself, a larger single bag is indeed more space-efficient than two smaller bags. But we’re not just packing bags here, but also a kayak.",n

When it comes to trimming the boat, with smaller bags, you do have more flexibility in adjusting the weight balance; especially on longer trips.

I actually got my pack down to 25 pounds! I eliminated my gas fired stove and replaced it with a wood burning Solo Stove. This eliminated the need to carry the canisters of fuel.

Trying to find just the right thing at the right time is easier if you don’t have to unpack and repack a bigger drybag. After a long paddle it isn’t easy to remember which bag has what in it. Also for lunch breaks having cooking gear organized with food prepackaged saves time and effort. I use a Jetboil and dehydrated meals but for others being able to “cook” requires an alcohol stove.

It’s also useful for hanging in a tree with damp stuff.

I did end up throwing extras away each day, simply because after 2 days, I knew what I was using and liked. Threw away or gave away what I knew I would not use. Also found that summer sausage and hard cheese were great. Tortillas and pita bread packed flat and were easy to store. Tuna in a pouch worked great.

I will be starting in Jacksonville and going up river. I have RV camped for many years and have minor canoe experience, but none in a kayak. As I start to get older , it’s time to start on my list. I have the advantage being near civilization most of the trip, not like Alaska or the boonies of Lake Superior as many of the trips commented on were. My target date is mid-March. I don’t have much equipment yet, not even the kayak. I expect to look at several on Craigs List next week and then start practicing and seeing how much equipment it will hold. I have no deadline for this trip. If it take 2-3 months that’s OK.

Your advice to pre-pack your boat before the trip, I knew, but failed to carry it out before hand which resulted in the overloaded deck. I’m planning a return trip for this coming March with more care to reducing the volume by replacing some items and leaving others in the vehicle or home.",n
2220,2214,p,"The Refuge requires leave-no-trace to the point that you must pack everything out . This is a wildlife refuge where plants and critters are more important than the visiting people. Because of this need to limit human impact on the wildlife is so great planning your meals is very important to the point that portion size and number of meals you bring into the refuge is a major consideration in trip planning. Any food not eaten must be carried out and not left in the composting toilets, or anywhere within the refuge.",n

2267,2256,p,"Absolutely essential if your route includes urban or rural sections is a lock and cable to secure your boat if you have to leave it unattended. I travel the Ontario canal systems, and frequently lock up my kayak when I head off to stock up in a town or at a lockstation. My kayak has a short, recessed metal rod to use to lock it up, but it is almost impossible to find a lock or cable that will fit through. My solution: I bought a gun lock which has a fine cable that slips neatly through the opening. I loop that through a standard bike cable, and hook the cable around a tree or picnic table or dock fitting or whatever. I carry the key in my life jacket and a spare in my day pack.",n

2297,2286,p,Great site. Thanks for the guidance. I’m an experienced wilderness canoe camper planning a solo kayak lake or river trip of 8-14 days next summer in northern Maine. I’ve done a little fresh water day kayaking but am not an experienced kayaker. I’ll be buying a kayak and am surprised that there doesn’t seem to be any kayak storage volume comparison chart anywhere online. I even called Wilderness Systems help line who make Dagger and Perception kayaks also and they don’t have any such thing. Seems like an important piece of info for multi-day kayak camping. Any guidance will be greatly appreciated.,n

2407,2396,p,"Great site and info. I am just starting out a different direction with inland river or pond or very small lake. I have two Pelicans, a 13 Hydyve and a 10 ‘ bounty Hunter as the freight mule. Behind that a Creek Cooler, b ou th towed with PVC pipe. Both taks are battery powered with solar charging and full navigation lights front and rear. Green fish light and iver head lights off the USB outlets. Both are Garmin striker4 equipment as well. I load very heavy and plan my outings less than a mile or more from the truck therefore multiple trips back to launching will be required to get it all in camp. The Coleman Big Sky tent will hold the cost, tables solves x3 and all cooking facilities. The tent also has 12v battery pack with solar charging for lighting and USB crank radio. Looking forward the February for the first adventure close to the ranch to see what can be weeded out. With two yaks I should be able to get most of the camp in first trip, fishing gear in the second. For now it’s all in the pickup box packed full. The fishing gear will ride to the lake side in the yaks which ride on a single axle PJ trailer fitted to the task with a rollercoaster ramp and winch system for launching. If anyone is in the south central region of Kansas be glad to hear from you. Tight lines. DS40_RANCH",n

2472,2469,br,I have a Wilderness Systems Tarpon 120 sit-on-top fishing kayak. It is great for fishing but not ideal for “touring”. We tend to go out to a lake or reservoir and base camp. Then do various day trips and come back to base camp.,n

2476,2473,br,"Be as detailed as you need to be. For example, if everything regarding cooking and kitchen gear is ALWAYS in one bag….list KITCHEN BAG as one item. Otherwise, list everything….stove, gas cans, forks, spoons, towel, dishpan, cutting board. ..",n

Cheap stuff will let you down in the worst way. Good stuff will last a long time. I have two large BajaBags from SealLine….that I have been using since about 1990.",n
2480,2468,p,"I stated using a IceMule cooler and it’s pretty darned cool . There are various sizes. I like the 20L size. Pack in a frozen half gallon of lemonade or juice instead of ice. Freeze all your meat first It does a good job of keeping meats, cheese, eggs, butter, etc.cold for up to five days if you’re careful.",n
2482,2468,p,"The larger heavy bags go in my rear deck well…which keeps them reasonably.low…but, they are certainly not centered fore or aft. Again, this is something that everyone is going to have to figure out with their own gear and their own boat.",n

We have started using what we call the “rubber ducky”. I have an older fiberglass WS Tarpon kayak. It’s ridiculously light. We tow it behind our kayaks and load it with heavy or bulky stuff that won’t fit safely on our boats. It works really well. But again, you really need to plan this stuff out before your trip…and go to a local.body of water to practice. With our setup I am fine on flat water, but seriously choppy water or high wind….I am going to postpone the journey. You HAVE to know your limits when you are heavily loaded. There’s much less tolerance than you would have with a good canoe.",n
