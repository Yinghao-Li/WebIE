364,132,p,And it’s a big business.,n
366,132,p,"From running shoes, technical clothing, performance socks, hydration belt, to sports bras, compression garments, heart monitors, and GPS watches, this niche is one of the most profitable sectors in the global fashion and sports equipment market.",n
373,132,h3,"So, What Do You Really Need?",n
375,132,p,"The answer depends on your personal preferences, training level, training goals, where you live, budget, and how much you love high-tech, stylish fitness gadgets.",n
377,132,p,Everyone is different and might be in the market,n
379,132,p,No suit fits all.,n

389,132,p,But how do you choose the right clothing and fabrics for running? That’s where the rest of this article comes in handy.,n

407,132,p,the leading causes of pain and injury.,n
409,132,p,"So, if you have a used pair gathering dust at the back of your closet, get rid of them, head to the closest specialty running store, and buy a new pair.",n
411,132,p,"I personally like Brooke and Nike running shoes, but feel free to try out other brands and styles.",n
413,132,p,"I’m not affiliated with any shoe brand, and I cannot recommend a perfect pair.",n
418,132,p,You decide.,n
423,132,h4,The Main Things,n
425,132,p,"So, how do you pick the right trainers?",n
427,132,p,"As a rule of thumb, fit, comfort, and flexibility should be the ultimate measuring criteria whenever you’re looking for a new pair.",n
429,132,p,Here are the golden tips,n
430,132,ul,,n
432,430,li,Go shopping,n

438,430,li,Leave enough wiggle room between your big toe and the end of the shoe—at least a thumbnail’s space.,n
440,430,li,"Don’t under nor over pay. A cheap pair will not provide with enough support and won’t last you that long, whereas a super expensive pair is uncalled for—especially if you’re just a recreational runner.",n
444,132,h4,Buy Quality,n
447,132,p,"Sure, the most expensive pair in the store is not inherently the best, but, at least, don’t skimp.",n
453,132,p,"You can always go for a low-priced pair, but often than not, these are made with rock-bottom, non-durable materials, which provide little to no protection.",n
456,132,p,"However, a mid-range shoe—80 to $120—usually has excellent cushioning and stability properties.",n
459,132,p,If you still want to save off a few bucks then go for last year’s version of a mid or top-range shoe.,n
462,132,p,"The differences won’t be that significant, but you’ll, at least, get a top-shelf pair for a fraction of the price.",n
464,132,p,Expect to pay,n
469,132,h3,Running Clothing,y
471,132,p,"Although they’re the most critical, shoes are not the only thing that makes your running comfortable and more enjoyable.",n
473,132,p,Clothing also matters.,n
476,132,h4,Get the Right Fabrics,n
478,132,p,"Let me start with the golden rule of workout attire—never, under any circumstance, wear cotton while running.",n

485,132,p,You’ll feel super cold in the winter and overeat in the hot season.,n
487,132,p,What’s more?,n
489,132,p,"Once cotton gets wet, it stays wet, turning into a scratchy material that can lead to blisters and discomfort .",n
493,132,p,"high performance, technical, material.",n
495,132,p,"These fabrics pull sweat away from your body in the same way a candle absorbs liquid; then transfer it to the outer surface, where it evaporates.",n

530,132,p,"thumb, steer clear of cotton shirts.",n
535,132,p,"Technical materials feel comfortable, light and cool against the skin, unlike cotton which, once it gets wet, it stays wet, turning into cumbersome and scratchy material that can cause chafed underarms and bleeding nipples .",n
539,132,p,"Furthermore, technical fabrics can regulate your body temperature by dissipating heat during hot weather training and retaining it when the temperature drops.",n
541,132,p,"A good running T-shirt is typically made from nylon, or brand names like Dri-Fit, Climalite or Coolmax.",n
543,132,p,"It should feel cool, light and comfortable against the skin.",n

580,132,p,Tights also work well for the overweight beginner as they often protect against chafing and painful irritation in the inner thighs.,n
