342,339,div,,n
344,342,h3,Things to consider when choosing candle making supplies,n
346,342,p,"To choose the best candle-making supplies, there are several things you need to consider before you make a purchase.",n
348,342,h3,What is the minimum you need in a candle-making kit?,n
350,342,p,There are a few basics you need in a candle-making kit. These include:,n
352,342,h4,Dye,y
354,342,p,"Candle dye is a colorant specifically made for candles. It comes in a block, liquid, or flake form. If you are dying soy wax and want a deep and vibrant color, opt for dye blocks. These will also vibrantly color large amounts of paraffin wax. If you want to create a more pastel shade of color, choose liquid candle dyes.",n
356,342,h4,Candle wax,y
358,342,p,"Candle wax is made from several different materials. Most candles are made from paraffin wax as this is an affordable and easily colored option. However, a paraffin wax candle creates smoke and burns a lot faster than other types of wax. Some studies have shown that burning paraffin candles releases some toxic chemicals like toluene. Toluene can cause a variety of ailments including nose irritation, tiredness, and headaches.",n
360,342,p,"You may want to choose a natural and less harmful wax such as beeswax, palm wax, or soy wax. These natural waxes are more slow-burning and create less smoke. However, natural waxes are more expensive and are more difficult to scent and color. If making a candle for a vegan, use any wax apart from beeswax as this is not vegan.",n
362,342,h4,Fragrance,y
364,342,p,"When choosing a fragrance for your candle, consider how strong you want the scent to be. Will this candle be placed in a large room where the scent has plenty of space to dissipate? Or will it be in a small room where a strong scent might be overpowering?",n
366,342,p,"If you have the opportunity to smell the scent before you make a purchase, do so. Scents can remind us of memories. If you are making a candle for a friend, perhaps you will want to incorporate a scent that reminds you of your childhoods, such as ice cream or the seaside.",n
368,342,p,"You may simply want to recreate your favorite scent. Make a list of your favorite scents before you make a purchase. With so many fragrances on the market, you will likely find a perfect match to your list.",n
370,342,h4,Melting pot,y
372,342,p,"The melting pot will melt your candle wax. Some melting pots are placed over boiling water to melt the wax and others can be used directly over a heat source. Using a double boiler melting pot means you won’t accidentally set fire to your candle wax. However, double boilers are almost always much smaller than a direct burner melting pot, meaning you won’t be able to meet as much wax at once.",n
374,342,p,"Ensure the melting pot is a decent size with a long heat-resistant handle. A dripless spout is a bonus. Also, look for a melting pot with a non-stick coating and measurements down the side. You will usually see stainless steel or aluminum melting pots. They are both great options but aluminum has the advantage of cooling quicker, preventing less accidental overheating of your candle wax.",n
376,342,h4,Thermometer,y
378,342,p,Thermometers come in different shapes and sizes. There aren’t discernible features you should look for. Just make sure your thermometer is made specifically for candle making and has a majority of good customer reviews.,n
380,342,h4,Candle containers,y
382,342,p,"Candles can be made in glass or tins. When choosing a candle container, ensure that is what it is intended for. Once you are a more experienced candle maker you can do some research into other containers you can use for your candles. Simply ensure the container will hold the correct volume of wax you had in mind.",n
384,342,h4,Stirring sticks,y
386,342,p,"Most full sets of candle-making kits will have stirring sticks. These are normally disposable wooden sticks like the ones you get with a coffee. That being said, if your candle-making kit doesn’t come with a stirrer you could use a coffee stirrer provided it doesn’t splinter.",n
388,342,p,"To save money in the long run, choose a reusable metal stirring stick.",n
390,342,h4,Candlewick centering device,y
392,342,p,You will need clips or a candle wick centering device to hold the wick in place whilst you pour the wax into the container. There are several types of clips used for candle making. Ensure the candle wick centering device isn't too small for your candle container.,n
394,342,h4,Candlewick,y
396,342,p,The candle wick is usually made from cotton. Ensure the candle wick is long enough for your candle. You can make a wick by using an old cotton shirt and a paper clip if you need to.,n
398,342,h4,Glue dots,y
400,342,p,"Glue dots hold the candle wick in place. Finding decent glue dots is pretty much trial and error, and involves reading plenty of customer reviews.",n
402,342,h3,How we choose the best candle making supplies,n
404,342,p,To choose the best candle-making supplies we judge the quality of the wax and judge the vibrancy of the dyes and the pleasantness of the included scents. We also judge whether the supplies include a complete set of everything you need to make a candle.,n
406,342,p,"We read countless customer reviews and only recommend products that have been tried and tested and have a majority of positive reviews. We understand that many readers may be making candles for the first time so we choose products that are easy to use, and are good value-for-money.",n
408,342,h3,Candle making supplies price range,n
410,342,p,"You can buy individual candle-making supplies for a few cents . Complete candle-making supply sets can cost as little as $12 and as much as $80. The more you spend, the more supplies you usually get.",n

414,411,div,,n
415,414,div,,n
419,415,div,How many candles should I make at first if I plan on selling them?,n
424,415,p,"Make at least 80 candles before you begin selling. This will give you time to perfect your craft. Give these candles away to friends and family if they aren’t quite right, or give away free samples to potential customers. This small gesture will create some repeat customs in the future.",n
425,414,div,,n
429,425,div,What are the most popular candle colors?,n
434,425,p,"The most popular candle colors are purple, blue, red, and peach. These candles often come with accompanying scents to match their color. Plain white unscented candles are also very popular mostly because they are used for different religious purposes.",n
435,414,div,,n
439,435,div,What is the most popular scent,n
444,435,p,The most common scent for candles is citrus fruits. Citrus scents create a fresh and refreshing space and are perfect for all seasons. Citronella is also an effective insect repellent. Gingerbread candles are extremely popular from fall until Christmas.,n
445,414,div,,n
449,445,div,How do you choose a fragrance oil?,n
454,445,p,"To choose a good fragrance oil, match the fragrance to the color of your candle. For instance, if you are making a blue candle, you might want to use an ocean-style fragrance.",n
