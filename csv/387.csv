109,25,h2,What Equipment Is Needed To Play Badminton,n
113,25,p,"Be it for fun, exercise, or developing a professional career in badminton, you will need equipment for badminton in order to play this amazing sport. While it might seem that you can start playing badminton with your friends with just a racket, a few shuttlecocks, and a net, if you’re wanting to take the sport a bit more seriously or want to improve your game then the list of equipment for badminton is pretty long to be honest. If you are wanting to start a badminton club, then it’s very important to have a complete list of equipment for badminton at your disposal.",n
114,25,p,,n
116,114,span,"I am going to provide you with the ultimate badminton equipment list in this article. I will try my best to include literally everything that one might need to play badminton, or to build facilities to start a badminton club. Moreover, I would also like to give you product recommendations for each category of equipment for badminton so that you don’t need to do the long, tedious work of doing all the research to find the best pieces of equipment in each category.",n
118,114,span,"We hope you love the products we recommend! As an Amazon Associate we earn from qualifying purchases, at no extra cost to you. Thank you if you use our links, we really appreciate your support!",n
121,25,p,"Here is the list, and the descriptions will follow:",n
125,25,h2,Badminton Racket,y
131,25,p,"The most obvious piece of equipment for badminton that you need to start playing badminton is a good badminton racket. Badminton rackets much lighter than tennis rackets due to their thin frame. In the vast majority of instances, badminton rackets don’t weigh over 100 grams. Badminton rackets come in different materials, but the most popular one is carbon fiber. The weight and balance point and string tension of a badminton racket might vary depending on the material that has been used to manufacture the racket.",n
133,25,h3,Best Badminton Racket,y
136,25,p,"For choosing a badminton racket, you should pay attention to your playing style. For singles, you need to be more active and run around the court more compared to doubles. If you are playing in a team of two, you will have specific roles depending on your position. Moreover, you should choose a racket that compliments your areas of strength. For example, if you are a strong player and depend heavily on powerful smashes to win points, then you need a racket that is a bit on the heavier side and can generate a lot of power while smashing the shuttlecock. On the other hand, if you are fond of taking your opponent to long rallies and winning points by intelligent placement of your shots, then lighter rackets will be better for you because of their mobility.",n
138,25,h3,Badminton Racket,y
141,25,p,"Badminton rackets also bring a wide range of price points. What you need to understand here is, you get what you pay for. You can’t expect a $10 badminton racket to perform as well as professional level Yonex rackets. That does not mean you need to pay a fortune to buy a racket to play badminton for fun, as a lot of decent options are available at affordable prices.",n
144,25,p,Here are some of my recommendations of the best badminton rackets available for all levels of badminton player – check them out:,n

446,25,h2,Badminton Shuttlecock,y
450,25,p,"Just like badminton rackets, the shuttlecock is another essential component of badminton. You simply can’t play badminton without a shuttlecock. This exactly why it’s a vital piece of equipment for badminton and is the second item on our list. If you are using traditional goose feather shuttlecocks, then you will need quite a few of them to complete a match because these shuttlecocks don’t last too many hits. However, competitive matches are played with goose feather shuttlecocks because they maintain the standard speed and aerobics that is required for the game. On top of that, they don’t damage racket strings too much.",n
452,25,h3,Synthetic Shuttlecocks,y
455,25,p,"Some players also play with synthetic shuttlecocks, and most of those shuttlecocks are made of nylon and plastic. Unlike goose feather shuttlecocks, synthetic shuttlecocks last much longer. You can even play 4-5 games with one single nylon shuttlecock. However, the main problem with these shuttlecocks is that they are fast and heavy. If someone can smash a nylon shuttlecock hard, it is unlikely that their opponent will be able to return their shot. Due to the extra weight of these types of shuttlecocks, they do put pressure on the badminton racket strings, and can tear the strings in the middle of a game.",n
458,25,p,"So, the point is, you should choose synthetic shuttlecocks only for practicing or playing for fun. If you are arranging a tournament there is no alternative to goose feather shuttlecocks. Professional players use goose feather shuttlecocks in their practice sessions as well, as they don’t want to get used to heavier shuttlecocks.",n
461,25,p,"However, in my recommendations I would like to include both types of shuttlecocks, you can simply pick whichever one fits your priorities and necessities.",n

1136,25,p,"For any sporting activity, a good pair of shoes is a must have and it’s also a very important piece of equipment for badminton. The sport of badminton requires the player to make quick movements and to be nimble on their feet. Without the correct badminton shoes you would not have the required traction and you’d be slipping on the surface when you tried to return a shot by your opponent. Without quick movements to get to the shuttlecock you’d guarantee loss after loss. Badminton is a sport where you need to run a lot, and without a good pair of badminton shoes you will fall behind an opponent who is wearing proper shoes. The correct cushioning is essential as it helps protect your feet from the pounding they take from the intense physical activity during a badminton match.",n

2076,25,p,"While most of the badminton rackets will come with strings, you need to consider spare racket strings anyway. Moreover, you might want to install premium racket strings in your affordable racket, which does not have pre-installed good quality strings.",n
2079,25,p,"Badminton strings are the most important component of a badminton racket and is really important equipment for badminton. After all, you are not going to smash the shuttle with the frame of your racket, right? To win points, you will have to make sure the shuttlecock meets the sweetest impact point of your racket strings. Good racket strings will take a long way in winning more matches.",n
2081,25,h3,How to Choose Badminton Racket Strings,n
2084,25,p,"For choosing racket strings, you need to consider three things in general: string construction, string gauge, and stringing tension. String construction stands for the process through which the string is made and the type of fiber used to manufacture it. String gauge means the thickness of the string, while string tension refers to the tightness of the strings when they are installed in a racket.",n
2086,25,h3,What are Badminton Racket Strings made of,n
2089,25,p,"In the past, most of the racket strings were made of nylon, but the current trend has shifted the production trend towards monofilament. The raw materials used for producing monofilament strings are polyester, polyether, or a mixture of different similar materials. Monofilament strings are traditionally more durable and stiff. Some players don’t find such stiff strings playable, as they tend to be quite unforgiving. That’s why softer monofilaments are getting more popular in recent times.",n
2091,25,h3,Badminton Racket String Facts,n
2094,25,p,"You should also know some basic facts about badminton racket strings. Firstly, if your racket’s string length is longer, you will be able to generate more power with less effort. Power can also be enhanced by using more elasticity. Secondly, Stiffer strings create more vibration in the racket, while the softer strings create significantly less vibration. Also, elastic strings tend to have more tension loss after you are done stringing them to your racket.",n

But as a matter of fact, string tension does not always depend on the type of racket strings you are using in your badminton racket. Moreover, you will not figure out the right string tension level that suits your playing style. That’s why string pull hooks are necessary.",n
2406,25,p,"Racket string pull hooks are easy to use, and can significantly help you improve your shots by adjusting the sweet spot of your racket. Buying one is definitely a great idea, and here are some recommendations.",n

2602,25,p,"If you want to become good at badminton, you have to hold your racket the right way. However, even if you know how to hold your racket for optimal usage, your sweaty hands might just let you down. Because of sweat, your racket might slip in your hand so that you are not holding your racket correctly or even slip out of your hand completely. Suppose your opponent made a very weak shot, and you have a great opportunity to smash. Right at the moment you are about to smash the shuttlecock and win the point, you lose control of your badminton racket because of sweat making your racket grip slippery. What can be more frustrating than that?",n
2604,25,h3,Why use a Badminton Racket Grip,n
2607,25,p,"This is why you should use a badminton racket grip. A good badminton racket grip will make sure that your sweat does not get in your way while playing an intense game. There are three types of grips you will usually see on the racket handles of professional badminton players. These are: replacement grips, overgrips, and towel grips.",n
2609,25,h3,Badminton Grip,y
2612,25,p,"The replacement grips are quite self-explanatory, to install a replacement grip you’ll have to replace the original low quality grip that came with your badminton racket. Generally, replacement grips are thicker than pre-installed grips. PU is the base material which is used to manufacture replacement grips. These grips are not only great shock and sweat absorbers, but also works as a cushion between the handle and your fingers.",n
2615,25,p,"Overgrips are installed over the original grips of your racket. These grips are thinner and cheaper. Like replacement grips, these grips are made of PU. As overgrips are wrapped over original racket grips, ultimately the thickness of the handle increases. They can absorb sweat as well.",n
2618,25,p,"If you want to increase the weight of your racket grip by a few grams, then towel grips should be your choice. Made of cotton, these grips are thick and heavy. For sweat absorption, no other grip is better than towel grips.",n

2929,25,p,"The standard badminton net height is five feet high, and at the edges its height can increase up to 1 inch. Different materials are used to manufacture badminton nets such as nylon, polyethylene, and vinyl. Nylon badminton nets are the most popular ones around different parts of the world, as they are the most affordable option of those three materials.",n
2931,25,h3,Quality Badminton Nets,y
2934,25,p,"What you need to make sure of while buying a badminton net is its ability to stop badminton shuttlecocks. Some low quality nets let badminton shuttles go through them if a player smashes with too much power. In some cases, it might result in someone unfairly losing points because the referee might not realized if the shuttlecock has gone through the net or over it. The holes in your badminton net should be small enough, so that shuttlecocks can’t go through it. At the same time, the net should not block a player’s sight as well. That’s why the correct hole dimensions need to be maintained for giving everyone a fair game. Take a look at our detailed reviews of the best Badminton net sets .",n

You might already have nets and poles in your local training facility or school badminton club, but for playing badminton in your backyard, you do need poles as well.",n
3244,25,p,"There is a difference between indoor and outdoor badminton poles. Outdoor badminton poles are not portable in most of the cases. They stick to the ground, and can’t be moved to a different court. On the other hand, indoor badminton poles are lighter and can be moved around in different courts with ease.

4284,25,p,"Most female badminton players wear shorts, just like the male players. However, there are some other options for female players other than shorts. Some women badminton players find it more comfortable to take part in tournaments wearing skirts or skorts. Skorts are a combination of a pair of shorts with a flap across the front, making it look like a skirt.",n
4287,25,p,"Just like the men badminton players, the women players should also avoid long pants. Here go the recommendations:",n

4603,25,p,"A good pair of badminton socks compliments your shoes very well. While playing badminton, your feet will definitely face a lot of stress. Also, because of so much movement, your feet will sweat as well. Feet sweat can make it really uncomfortable for you while playing the game for an extended period of time. On top of that, your feet might even slip inside your shoes at critical moments. That’s why you should not just go to play badminton with regular socks that your granny gifted you for Christmas. As much as we love granny’s Peppa Pig socks, they are simply not made for sports",n
4605,25,h3,What to look,n
4608,25,p,"There are some other factors you should keep in mind while purchasing socks for playing badminton. Make sure you are not allergic to any of the materials that have been used to manufacture your socks of choice. If you end up purchasing a pair with materials you are allergic to, you won’t even be able to wear them.",n
4611,25,p,"The most common pattern of badminton socks is crew cut. Crew cut socks go up to the middle part of your shin. In recent times, some players are preferring long tube compression socks over regular crew cut socks. I would not personally recommend that you purchase low cut socks, as they tend to fall off quite often. This will hamper your concentration as you might even have to take your shoes off to fix your socks in the middle of a match.",n
4613,25,h3,Badminton Sock Maintenance,n
4616,25,p,"Taking proper care of your badminton socks is vital as well. Badminton socks are performance socks, and in my experience, such socks are not suitable for dryers. Regardless of what the manufacturer says, don’t throw them in a dryer rather let them air dry by hanging on a clothes line. This way you will be able to use the same pair of socks for a lot of matches. Who wants to buy socks every now and then, right?",n

4926,25,p,"Even if you are playing badminton just for fun, you should try to give it your best effort. The excitement of the game exponentially increases when it’s competitive. That’s why you should try to get all the gear professional badminton players use, including sweatbands.",n
4928,25,h3,What to Consider when Choosing Sweatbands,n
4931,25,p,"While purchasing headbands and wristbands, you need to consider three things: moisture management, fit as well as style and color. Moisture management is the main purpose of any sweatband, so you have to give utmost importance to this factor. You should purchase only those wristbands that are made of moisture-wicking fabric. That’s why most of the sweatbands are made of cotton. However, your sweatbands should not be too tight or too loose. If you wear sweatbands that are too tight, you will feel really uncomfortable.",n
4934,25,p,"Wearing tight headbands can even give you a headache which will obviously impair your concentration during your badminton game. On the other hand, if your headbands are too loose then they will slide down your head or if your wristbands are too loose then they’ll slide down your hands, giving you a really irritating experience.",n
4937,25,p,"And lastly, the style and color of your sweatbands should match with your hairstyle and the rest of your badminton clothing. Even though this will not directly impact your performance, it always feels great to look good.",n

4942,25,p,"I will recommend sweatbands, including headbands and wristbands, which are ideal for preventing the sweat running down your face or hands.",n

5425,25,p,"Well, I think it’s really obvious why you need a water bottle for playing badminton. It’s not a part of the game directly, but I think you understand the importance of keeping yourself hydrated during a badminton match. The first thing professional players do once a set is over, is to hydrate themselves. You can also bring electrolyte or shakes to the match in your water bottle. Water bottles are necessary for not only competitive matches, but also for practice sessions. Keeping yourself hydrated gives you more energy, and takes care of your health as well which is why water bottles are important equipment for badminton players.",n

5736,25,p,"No one wants to get injured during a badminton game or a practice session. But injuries are unfortunate, and can occur at any time. Keeping a first aid kit with you during badminton matches and practice sessions is highly recommended. First aid kits will not be able to help you that much if the injury is too serious, but for minor injuries first aid kits will save you the time you would’ve otherwise needed to go to a clinic.",n

6042,25,h2,Badminton Racket Stringing Machine,y
6046,25,p,"I’ll be very honest, racket stringing machines are not must-have tools for badminton enthusiasts. If you need new strings to be installed in your racket, you can simply go to your local racket shop and get it done and have your badminton racket back within a day or 2. However, if you are starting a badminton club, then you need to have racket stringing machines. Your badminton club should be able to cater to the needs of the players, and getting new strings installed in rackets is one of the regular needs of badminton players. It could also be a good form of income for the badminton club too.",n
6048,25,h3,"If you want it done right, do it yourself!",n
6051,25,p,"Some players also like to string their own badminton rackets. Very often others don’t understand the individual needs of the particular badminton player, and deliver results that are not ideal. On top of that, purchasing a stringing machine is a long term solution. It saves money over time as well. If you go to your local shop to have new strings installed every time you need the service, you will have to pay every time as well. Over time, these expensive machines can in fact save you some money.",n
6054,25,p,"To purchase the right stringing machine, consider its mechanism, ease of use and longevity. Don’t go with machines that have complicated mechanisms, as the learning curve will be pretty long with one of these.",n

6366,25,p,"You should only purchase a badminton shuttlecock shooting machine if you are really serious about badminton and want to play at a higher level than you’re currently at. Shuttlecock shooting machines are great for practicing on your own. This is a brilliant piece of equipment for badminton. To improve your returns and smashes, a shuttlecock shooting machine can be your best friend. In fact, in some cases, these machines can be better than practicing with human players. Human badminton players won’t be able to deliver the shuttlecock to you maintaining the same flight, but a shuttlecock shooter will do that effortlessly.",n
