57,55,p,"Once you get a horse , you'll need a few basic pieces of equipment so you can care for it properly, and of course, enjoy the activity that you bought it for, whether that be riding or driving. Many of the things you may already own if you have a country property. The pitchforks, wheelbarrows, and shovels used for cleaning up after horses are the same as you what you would buy in any hardware store for gardening or other yard work. There are some specialty items you'll need to pick up at your local tack shops, such as special brushes and the tack for riding and driving.",n
62,55,p,"Although bits, bridles, and saddles might be something you're excited to acquire before you bring your horse home , it might be best to wait. That way, you'll be able to custom fit your horse, keeping it comfortable and happy. Other items like brushes, buckets, and lead ropes can be purchased well ahead of time, so they’re waiting for your horse when it arrives. You should also have several weeks' supply of hay and any supplements or grain you decide to feed your horse. Your fences and stable should be ready. You’ll need some type of bedding if your horse will be stabled at all, and of course, you’ll need a good supply of fresh water.",n
