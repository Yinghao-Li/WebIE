33,30,p,"Apart from a good sewing machine and spools, there are various other essential sewing tools that you’ll need to keep handy as you’ll be reaching out for them from time to time. It’s best to make a note of these essentials and always keep them at hand for sewing ‘emergencies’!",n
36,30,p,We’ve made the task easier by listing out a few essential tools that you should definitely have in your sewing kit.,n
39,30,h3,Fabric Shears,y
50,30,div,"Yes, fabric shears are definitely one of the most important items that you’ll need to stock in your sewing kit. It’s important to keep them separate and not use them for any other projects apart from sewing as their blades can dull out and end up damaging the fabric. It is also important to invest wisely in them instead of opting for the cheapest ones as good ones can last you for a long time.",n
63,30,h3,A Rotary Cutter And A Clear Plastic Ruler,y
71,30,div,,n
72,71,text,Rotary cutters can be really useful in cutting out patterned fabrics and are much easier to use as compared to fabric scissors. Their blades need to be kept sharp for the best results. They can also be easily replaced them from time to time.,n
75,71,br,"The rotary cutter should always be rolled away from the body. It’s advisable to never cut in a ‘backwards’ direction i.e towards yourself as this can be very dangerous. It’s also crucial to keep your fingers away from the cutter. If you are a righty, then hold the ruler with your left hand while cutting down the right side of the ruler. Lefties can do the opposite.",n
78,71,br,A clear plastic ruler can help in straightening your fabric’s edges and also helps in measuring out and cutting out fabric with precision.,n
86,30,h3,Seam Ripper,y
96,30,div,,n
97,96,text,Mistakes do happen to the best of us – and this little tool can be of big help during those tough times. This tiny tool can help you cut and remove unwanted stitches.,n
101,96,br,"Apart from its obvious use, it can also be used to cut open buttonholes as well as to turn out tiny corners! It can also come in handy when you need to open a slit into an applique fabric . Now that’s value for money!",n
104,96,br,Do make sure that you invest in one that comes with a sturdy and comfortable handle.,n

123,119,span,"es, we know what all the pin-lovers are thinking! But these little tools are much easier and safer to handle! They are extremely useful to hold layered sections without distortion. And as they come with flat backs and flat sides – they can be used to hold fabric at a flat angle so that the hem or edge doesn't pucker or wrinkle up.",n
134,30,div,"The major advantage of investing in these is that you can even use them for fabrics such as laminate, leather, vinyl, silk, satin wherein using pins is not suitable. Now that’s a win-win situation!",n
139,30,h3,Fabric Markers,y
150,30,div,"Every sewing tool kit should have fabric markers to mark notches and lines on fabric. Yes, you can use traditional products such as the tailor chalk, tracing carbon paper and tracing wheel or ceramic lead pens. But aren’t we all a little tired of them breaking, being less visible or fading away too soon? This is where these smart heat erasable marker gel pens can act as a lifesaver!",n
159,30,div,The unique gel ink of these pens makes clear marks on fabrics and disappears after ironing. Their sharp and accurate writing point leaves a thin yet clear line on every kind of fabric,n
168,30,div,Now you wouldn’t have to worry about your lines fading away when you don’t want them to or smudging or spoiling the rest of your fabric! How amazing is that?,n

212,209,p,When I learned how to sew we used a tracing wheel to mark darts and such. I have learned other ways to sew these but I’m making a pleated skirt with the pleats sewn down 4 inches. I would like to make these so they are perfect when I sew them down. What is the best way to do this?,n

232,229,p,I would like to see a seam ripper with a blade so you can just get it under the fabric and take several stitchs out a time. I have been using eye brow blades but surely there must be something heavier than those.,n
