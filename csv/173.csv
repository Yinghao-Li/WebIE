21,2,div,,n
23,21,p,The Penland textiles program offers beginning to advanced workshops in traditional and contemporary methods. Two studios provide space and specialty equipment for the exploration of concept and technique in textiles. The scope of each workshop is determined by the instructor with input from our program director and support from our programming staff. Our versatile facility and high caliber artist or educators allow us to provide relevant programming in topics from natural dying and weaving to mixed media sculpture and everything in between. We strive for a balance of technical and aesthetic content and value all cultural and historical perspectives. We offer workshops that inspire and challenge students from curious beginners to accomplished professionals. Our programming is current in spirit and respectful of craft traditions.,n
25,21,p,"The studios are very flexible, but are particularly well equipped for weaving , dyeing, printing, basketry, felting, knitting, and sewing . The range of workshop topics includes but is not limited to natural dying, double weave, shibori, screenprinting, contemporary quilt design, sculptural basket forms, digital jacquard, millinery, beading, shoemaking, and soft sculpture. Materials and techniques are combined in a myriad of ways, and instructors often ground technical exploration with conversations about historic and or or current context, design, or idea generation. Recent instructors include: Bhakti Ziek, Tommye McClure Scanlin, Wayne Wichern, Saberah Malik, Catharine Ellis, Joy Boutrop, Chrisitina Roberts, Kyoung Ae Cho, Natalie Chanin, Amy Putansu, Susan Iverson, Charllotte Kwon, Akemi Nakano Cohn, Tim Eads, Rachel Meginnes, María Dávila, Eduardo Portillo, Amara Hark, and Lisa Sorrell, among many others.",n
27,21,p,"Our workshops take place in two well-equipped, well-maintained, and safe textiles studios designed to accommodate diverse content and working styles. There are work or print tables or looms for each student, two well-ventilated dye kitchens, a screenprinting spray booth, washer and dryer, and a sewing room.",n
