States with existing regulations are not required to alter their status. Make sure you check your state regulations before getting underway with children onboard.",n

341,67,h3,Ventilation,y
343,67,p,"Coast Guard requirements on ventilation differ depending on the date your boat was manufactured. The requirements don’t change depending on the size of your vessel, just the date it was built.",n

349,347,strong,Boats built on or after 8 or 1 or 1980:,n
350,347,text,"At least two ventilation ducts capable of efficiently ventilating every closed compartment that contains a gasoline engine and or or tank, except those having permanently installed tanks that vent outside of the boat and which contain no unprotected electrical devices.",n

369,67,h2,Other Things To Consider,n
371,67,p,"It’s worth noting that some states have requirements in addition to the federal requirements. Make sure that you check your state’s boating laws for additional requirements. While these aren’t always mandatory, we’ve put together a short list of things that are essential to keep aboard, no matter what size your boat is.",n
376,67,h3,First Aid Kit,y
378,67,p,"A first aid kit should be kept on board. Make sure it has a selection of band aids and bandages, as well as range of medication.",n
380,67,h3,Tools,y
382,67,p,Keeping tools on your boat can help you out in a bind. Don’t rely on pocket knives and multi-tools; having the right tool for the job will make minor repairs much easier.,n
384,67,h3,VHF Radio,y
386,67,p,"No boat should leave the marina without some kind of practical communication device. While some boaters are confident enough to leave with just a cell phone, a portable VHF radio will be of far more use in an emergency .",n
390,67,h3,Emergency Fuel And Water,y
392,67,p,"Spare fuel is sensible to have on board. You don’t want to get caught out with an empty fuel tank. Similarly, extra reserves of drinking water should also be kept aboard.",n
394,67,h3,Bilge Pump,y
396,67,p,"While most large vessels will have bilge pumps as standard, we recommend traveling with a manual bilge pump to help bail out water in the event of a power failure. A bucket will also work, but a dedicated bilge pump is a better tool for the job .",n
400,67,h3,Sun Protection,y
402,67,p,A bottle of sunscreen should be kept along with your first aid kit. There will be at least one occasion when you head out on the water but forget to bring some sun protection.,n
406,67,h3,An Anchor,y
408,67,p,"An anchor and chain may help in an emergency. If you can keep yourself anchored to a single point, it will be easier for authorities to find you. An anchor with enough chain should be kept aboard all recreational boats .",n
412,67,h2,In Summary,n
414,67,p,"The U.S Coast Guard’s minimum requirements are just that: the minimum requirement. We recommend that you exceed these requirements where possible. There’s nothing wrong with carrying more PFDs than you need, or equipping more visual distress signals than the rule book says.",n
418,67,p,"Don’t forget, these Coast Guard boat requirements are in place to keep you safe. Besides, if you don’t follow the rules and end up having an accident, your insurance company won’t pay you a dime if you didn’t take the necessary precautions.",n
420,67,p,"For peace-of-mind, we recommend that you contact your neared branch of the U.S. Coast Guard or U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary for a voluntary Vessel Safety Check.",n

Do this law override the name plate if the boat is dated older than the law. Bass Boats now that are over 20 all have 250ho motors. Could I get some info please.,n
