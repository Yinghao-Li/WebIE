181,174,text,". What's the difference? Price and quality. Artist Quality paints have better coverage and more punch, therefore it's more expensive than Student Quality paints. Yep, it's tempting to go for the Student Quality paints, because they are cheaper... however, I would generally suggest that you avoid the Student paints. They contain more filler and less pigment, so the results will be less satisfactory than the more superior Artist Quality paints. With that said, if budget is an issue, then go with what you can afford. But if you can, buy a tube or two of the Artist Quality paints as well, so that you can see and feel the difference for yourself.",n
183,171,p,"Acrylic paints come in tubes, bottles and jars. They also come in a range of sizes, from 2oz to 32oz. If you're just starting out, stick with the 2oz size. That way you can decide if you like the brand before investing in more. Those 2oz tubes can last a loooong time, depending on whether you paint large or small. I have had many of my 2oz tubes for years. Therefore, if you're a total beginner trying out acrylics, go for the smaller tubes or jars!",n
