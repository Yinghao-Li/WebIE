392,381,div,IMPORTANT,n
395,381,div,"IMMEDIATELY AFTER GAMES, WASH YOUR GAME JERSEY - DO NOT LET THEM SIT DIRTY…..the perspiration on them greatly increases the risk of dye or color migration and lessens the life of the jersey.",n
398,381,div,WASH jerseys INSIDE OUT with a Mild Detergent using in COLD WATER on GENTLE CYCLE and then HANG DRY . DO NOT BLEACH and DO NOT PUT IN THE DRYER! White jerseys will turn yellow if bleach products or bleach alternative products are used.,n

Your attention will enable Beaverton Youth Football to control costs and provide equipment to all future participants.",n
415,381,div,HELMET CARE,n
418,381,div,Try keeping your helmet clean and free of debris. You can do this by simply wiping with a damp cloth. NEVER use abrasive cleaners or solvents to clean helmet. The Carmel Rams Youth Football Equipment Managers have special helmet cleaning solutions if a damp cloth will not work.,n

440,381,div,"Do not allow perspiration soaked or muddy garments to lie in a pile or rest on top of each other for any period of time. Launder them immediately if they really, really need it. However, it is not necessary to launder after every wearing. Simply hang them on a plastic or wooden hanger until the next day of practice.",n
