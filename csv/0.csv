344,311,p,"Players should try on the gear for proper fit, especially the helmet. Most items can be picked up used via craigslist but take warning on using used helmets. Make sure they have their safety sticker intact and that the helmet fits your player. The helmet is the number one safety equipment to take seriously. Most helmets have a 3-5 year life cycle. Buyer by ware. If in doubt, buy a new one.",n

362,311,p,"As per the rules of girls lacrosse, there is less contact and checking involved as the boy's game. This is the reason why the girls do not wear all the padding as the boys do. However, some parents might need the peace of mind to outfit their players with a ""soft headgear"" protection.",n
