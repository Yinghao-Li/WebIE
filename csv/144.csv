48,46,p,Planning any event is a lot of work. Planning a wedding is on a totally different level. We’re talking about the Olympics of event planning. That’s why you need a wedding decor checklist.,n
50,46,p,"With that in mind, it’s no wonder certain elements inevitably get missed or forgotten. Now, is it really going to matter if you don’t have a sign labeling your guest book table? Or your forget convenience items for the bathrooms? Absolutely not. But having a wedding decor checklist can help eliminate these oopsies, making your life easier.",n
52,46,p,And that’s what we are all about here at The Budget Savvy Bride: helping our brides save money AND assisting them in making the process as painless as possible.,n
54,46,p,"Below you will find a detailed wedding decor checklist, with every decor element you can possibly think of listed. Of course, don’t feel obligated in any way to have all of these items at your big day. But we figured it would be better to have an exhaustive list than to forget something especially important.",n

75,46,h2,"Wedding Signage, Labels, and Printables",y
83,46,p,"Gone are the days of hastily made signs on poster board. The same goes for your guests wondering where to go or when something starts. Now, beautifully made signs and labels have become not only super popular but incredibly beneficial to weddings. And they lend a level of personality, which isn’t always easy to do with flowers or other decor.",n
85,46,p,"Etsy is by far our favorite source for signs, labels, and printables. What’s great about Etsy is you can find an artist to create a finished product for you or you can print them out yourself, using places like Vistaprint , Walgreens , or even your own home printer, to create your signage.",n
92,46,p,"What’s even cooler is how many free printable downloads you can find on the internet. As an example, our Printables section is pretty darn fabulous. Alternatively, Pinterest is chock-full of wedding signs and printables, many for free.",n
98,46,h3,A note on DIY decorations,n
100,46,p,We’re also a big proponent of using Cricut to further personalize your decor. Something as plain as a chalkboard purchased from Michaels or a piece of scrap wood can end up looking beautiful with a bit of Cricut-ing. Check out some of the Cricut projects we’ve created in the past.,n
108,46,p,"Lastly, labels can be easily created and printed via your home computer and printer. I personally recommend the brand Avery for labels and this fantabulous all-in-one Canon inkjet printer for your home printing needs.",n
114,46,p,One important thing to remember,n
116,46,p,"Here’s our list of some potential signs, labels, and printables you may need for your wedding, depending on your venue and setup:",n

171,46,h2,Flowers + Floral Wedding Decor,y
179,46,p,"I think we can all agree that in the past, flowers were the most popular way to decorate for weddings. As for today…. nothing has changed. Flowers almost always have a part in a couple’s wedding.",n
181,46,p,"Keep in mind that these flowers don’t have to be fresh, real, or realistic looking. If your budget is tight, you may want to seek out wedding floral alternatives for more cost-friendly options. Several of our couples from our previous Real Weddings features have made bouquets and other decor out of book pages, fabric, buttons, or even brooches. Still, the fact remains: flowers tend to be an integral part of getting married.",n
190,46,h3,A note on flowers,n
192,46,p,"We’ve come up with a pretty extensive list of floral pieces one could use in a wedding. Remember that this wedding decor checklist is meant to be super thorough and exhaustive, and you most likely will not include every item on these lists – nor are you meant to! Prepare to start crossing off items on the list, even before you’ve started sourcing your flowers. It’s just our goal to not miss a single thing that a bride could possibly want on their big day. You choose the items that feel right and good to you, and ditch the rest!",n
194,46,p,"Lastly, remember to peruse our flower tutorials and informational articles . You will find valuable information on saving big on blooms, not to mention step-by-step instructions to do it yourself if you’re up to the challenge!",n

252,46,p,"Interestingly enough, the most important part of most people’s wedding – the ceremony – often requires the least amount of decor. At least with regards to our wedding decor checklist. Still, there are some very integral pieces that you will not want to forget.",n
254,46,p,"You may spend thousands on your ceremony, or just a few hundred bucks. Regardless, you’ll want to make sure you have everything you want and need for this incredibly special experience.",n

306,46,p,"In my opinion, the reception is typically where you will spend the most money, time, and effort. Putting together a meal, entertainment, desserts and favors takes a lot of foresight and detailed planning.",n
310,46,p,"Receptions are as unique as you are. You may only have ten guests and be foregoing a meal altogether. On the flip side, you may have 200 guests and serving a 3-course dinner followed by dancing and a band. But there are still a list of items that everyone needs to consider for their wedding reception. These include:",n
