79,77,p,"Kayaking is a great way to get out in nature and enjoy the many beautiful lakes , rivers, and estuaries the U.S. has to offer. And thankfully, the activity's barrier to entry is pretty low. While buying a kayak might not be on the radar of first timers just yet, there are many national outfitters and outdoor sports shops— REI and Dick's Sporting Goods included—that offer kayaks for rent. Your local marina, park district, or gear shop may be a good place to rent, too. And many national parks, like Grand Teton National Park and Everglades National Park , have outfitters inside.",n

112,77,p,"If you are looking to invest in a kayak, options abound: Choose from hard shell kayaks from Eddyline , inflatable kayaks from Advanced Elements or Sea Eagle , or Oru’s foldable kayaks . When you buy a kayak, you will need to buy paddles and a life jacket separately. When you rent a kayak, most rental places include these essentials in the price of rental—ideal for the beginner who doesn't have any paddling gear.",n

156,77,h2,Water shoes,y
158,77,p,"Apart from the kayak, paddles, and life jacket, a good pair of water shoes is key for a comfortable day on the water. Most kayaks will take on some water, especially the sit-on-top kind . Additionally, you will get your feet wet as you push off from the pier and when you come back as you step out to pull the kayak back to shore. Water shoes provide much needed grip as you step on the moss-slick pier or rocky river bottom.",n

187,77,p,"Clothing options for kayaking are similar to other outdoor activities like hiking or trekking. The key is to aim for breathability, comfort, and protection against cold and wet conditions. According to the U.S. Coast Guard, a good rule of thumb is to dress for water temperatures—which can generally be found by a quick Google search—not air temperatures. Apps like Water Temperature or Buoyweather Marine Forecasts can give you specific temperature details for oceans and lakes worldwide. This is even more important if you plan to spend the whole day out on the water. Dress in layers and wear clothing that is quick drying and is made with UPF-rated fabrics for optimal sun protection .",n

Even if you aren’t sea kayaking, it is never a good idea to drink water from lakes, rivers, or estuaries without any form of filtration . And as responsible travelers, opt for carrying a reusable water bottle whenever possible. From Hydro Flasks to S’well bottles , there are many options to choose from. If space is an issue, collapsible water bottles are a great idea to pack for a day of paddling—and bring along a SteriPen in case you need to refill on the water.",n
