Or consider renting heavy gear .",n
83,77,p,"That said, from the slopes to après-ski fun , there are a few essential pieces of clothing and gear items that are best not rented. And when you know the trusted cold weather brands to invest in, you can count on that wool sweater, those Gore-Tex lined boots, leather mitts, and down jacket to last for many, many years to come.",n

111,77,p,"The best ski towns are often pedestrian-friendly and village-like , which means that after a day on the slopes, you’ll likely want to walk over to dinner and cocktails. You’ll need footwear that keeps you warm and dry while offering good traction on slippery surfaces, too. But that hardly means you have to go too heavy-duty and forgo style—sneaker-style boots might serve you just as well as something sturdier, too. Do consider sizing up for extra warmth, however. That way, you can layer a good pair of wool socks underneath to keep those toes extra cozy.",n

247,77,p,"When you're spending time outside in the snow, layering is key. For your basic ski or snowboard kit, you’ll need wool long underwear , a synthetic or down jacket, and an outer shell to ward off wind and other elements. Of course, you can also consider going full jumpsuit or overalls on the mountain, too, to keep everything zipped into one neat package that’s both retro-cool and extra warm. When it’s time to segue to après-ski, shed those bulkier layers for cozy sweaters, down joggers, and tailored hoodies.",n

Gloves or mittens, beanies, wool socks, and neck warmers will keep all the body parts where you first lose heat nice and toasty.
