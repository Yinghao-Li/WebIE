1123,1112,p,"I love this article and it’s nice to know I have most of these knitting essentials in my possession. I live on a tight budget and I sew so I’ve made my own project bags of various sizes and needle organizers as well. I actually need to make a new one for my collection of recently acquired interchangeable circular needles. I also do beading work and make my own stitch markers which I love doing. I don’t own a ball keeper thing but I’ve always just used a big ziplock bag with a corner snipped off. It works so well and you can just toss it in a project bag. It’s a great way for me to reuse bags that come my way. I just might put on my Christmas list for a cute bowl though. Something I can leave for one of my granddaughter’s someday. I do want to purchase a yarn ring because I enjoy knitting with multiple colors at times. One thing you didn’t mention which I think is pretty essential is a book of knitting basics. I bought a nice little book “Knitting 200 Q and A” by Rita Taylor. It has been a great help to me over the years. Yes, I turn to the internet at times but this little book is a true gem. I didn’t learn to knit from a friend or relative. Everything I know about knitting I’ve learned from books and research. I started knitting after becoming disabled and loosing my career and life long love of oil painting. Knitting helped pulled me out of a deep dark depression. I’ve been blessed to teach a few people the beauty of knitting but I’m sure that there may be others like me who depend on books to help them grow in their knowledge of the art.",n
