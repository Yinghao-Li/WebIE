463,460,h2,Climbing Rope,y
466,460,p,"Unless you're Alex Honnold , you'll need a rope for rock climbing. Specially designed climbing ropes attach to anchors, and extensive training should be had before building anchors and using ropes. Beginners will hear about two types of rope: dynamic and static. Both are designed to withstand many thousands of pounds of force. Static ropes have little stretch and are used mainly for rappelling and hauling. Dynamic ropes are designed to stretch up to 30 percent, which absorbs much of the shock of a fall. Dynamic ropes are used for rock climbing. Mammut's Eternity Protect Climbing Rope is an excellent choice for a variety of climbing after proper training.",n

481,475,p,"Carabiners come in a variety of designs for a variety of uses. Locking carabiners use a threaded or otherwise secured gate to prevent the gate from accidentally opening during use. They're used for critical situations, including attaching a belay device and rope to a belayer or a person rappelling. Gates should always be checked to make sure they are securely locked before use. The Petzl Spirit 3D Screw Lock is a solid example of a locking carabiner.",n

491,488,h2,Belay Device,y
494,488,p,"Typically, climbing is a two-person sport. There's the climber on the wall and the belayer on the ground whose job is to take up rope slack. Falls generate a great deal of force, so the belayer wears a harness and uses a belay device attached to the harness. The climbing rope passes through the belay device and the carabiner that connects it to the harness and can be used to control friction. The belayer lets out rope as her partner ascends and can quickly lock the rope with the device in the event of a fall. Belay devices are also used when rappelling. The Black Diamond ATC is a long-time climbing favorite.",n
