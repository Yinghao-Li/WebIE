The .1 refers to whether the system has a subwoofer or not, so the .1 in a 7.1 system = one subwoofer. The last number, for example the .2 in a 5.1.2 system = how many Dolby Atmos speakers are in the set-up. So a 5.1.2 home theater means 5 speakers, 1 subwoofer, and 2 Dolby Atmos speakers.",n

1731,1727,p,,n
1733,1731,span,"Before you even start, consider how loud or how dead your room is. Try clapping your hands. If you hear a hint of an echo, the room is probably too loud as a result of hard walls, wood or tile floors, lots of window glass, etc. Conversely, if you hardly hear the clap, your room may be too dead . Ideally, your room should be as acoustically neutral as possible.",n

Screen-reader users also get automatic announcements to turn the Screen-reader mode on as soon as they enter the website.",n
