400,391,h2,Choose carefully,n
403,391,div,,n
406,403,p,Equipment is one of the most important purchases every esthetician will make and quality is very important. You will need all of your equipment to last. It is a big investment and one that can make or break your success.,n
408,403,p,"There are two mentalities when it comes to purchasing esthetician equipment. Should you try to save the most money or should you get the best quality? We take both these into consideration in this blog by giving you different options, and also by identifying for you the equipment and supplies every esthetician needs.",n
414,303,div,,n
422,414,h2,Learn From Our Mistakes,n
425,414,div,,n
427,425,p,"Trust me. We made a lot of mistakes over the years, but I think the worst mistakes we made were in sacrificing quality to save a buck. After buying a piece of equipment one year, only to have it break the next, we finally learned what really saves a spa money – and that’s buying smart. Here are some tips that can save you money in time, trouble, and actual dollars and cents. As you read each one, you can probably imagine the problems we encountered, and why they are in this list.",n
428,425,ol,,n
430,428,li,"First, choose an equipment manufacturer and distributor that has been in business for at least 10 years and offers a warranty. See #4 below.",n
432,428,li,Make sure the manufacturer offers replacement parts and will continue to offer replacement parts even if the equipment is discontinued.,n
434,428,li,Know which country your equipment is manufactured in. You will find better equipment that is manufactured outside of Asia.,n
436,428,li,"Make sure you purchase from a company you can count on, that offers excellent customer service and will be there for you if your equipment would break down. Fly by night companies that are here today and gone tomorrow won’t be around if your equipment breaks down. And then you may be stuck with expensive repairs or replacement.",n
438,428,li,"Choose a company to invest in that will invest in you, one that goes above and beyond with both product development and equipment safety. Look at their history. Study the company. Read their reviews. It should be obvious.",n
440,425,p,"The equipment you purchase will influence the treatments you will be able to offer and also affect the comfort of your clients. You want your clients to feel relaxed, safe, secure and impressed with the facial equipment you have. So choose carefully.",n
442,425,p,"But you’re probably wondering, how does one choose the best esthetician equipment for their business – those essential must-haves that deliver the absolute best experience for their clientele?",n
444,425,p,"Well, that’s exactly why we are writing this blog. Read on. ,",n
450,303,div,,n
455,450,h2,Start with the Basics,n
458,450,div,,n
460,458,p,"Before you actually go shopping, start with two checklists: one for your must-have esthetician equipment, another for supplies. These are the items that you absolutely need to do business. This can be different depending on unique situations, but a generalized list is a must.",n
462,458,p,"We rely on the basics. You will always need these items. They are not trendy but have been proven for years. So let’s not change a winning solution because basics work, especially when you are starting out.",n
464,458,p,So here we go – the essential equipment and supplies CSS feels every esthetician needs.,n
469,450,h2,Esthetician Equipment Must-Haves Checklist,n
492,303,div,,n
504,492,div,,n
508,504,h4,Facial Bed,y
514,504,p,"Depending on budget you will choose a pneumatic, hydraulic or an electric bed. See our blog Which Facial Bed Is Right for Estheticians to learn more about these options.",n
528,492,div,,n
532,528,h4,Esthetician Air Lift Stool or Chair,y
537,528,p,"Standing for 8-10 hours a day is not an option for most estheticians, so you’ll need a stool . Choose one that has silent castors so you can move freely without undue noise. Make sure the height is adjustable. I like an ergonomic designed cushion to help improve blood circulation.",n
549,492,div,,n
553,549,h4,Magnification Lamp,y
559,549,p,"Choose a good sturdy model with a minimum 5x diopter that uses LED technology. Then you will never have to change the bulb. Some mag lamps will offer a dimmer light intensity control for clients who have sensitivity to light. A model that has a glass lens will last without the lens becoming opaque or scratching. A magnifying lamp that has a fully open metal arm will end the chance of plastic covers breaking over the years. Magnifying lamps can attach to a wall, sit in your cart, or sit in a magnifying base. Where and how you decide to mount your mag lamp will depend on your space. You do have to know how much arm extension your mag lamp will need to have depending on the lamp’s location. Arm reach varies per mag lamp model so make sure to double check and know your room design.",n
571,492,div,,n
575,571,h4,Auxiliary Table,y
581,571,p,"You may need more than one auxiliary table depending on your treatment room. Do you need an auxiliary table to hold equipment, to hold product, both? Do you need your table to have a drawer or multiple drawers to hold supplies? There are many different auxiliary tables to choose from, once again choose a trusted manufacture and distributor, again choose a sturdy model and one that can hold 100 lbs. I like carts that offer silent castors so they can move quietly, carts that offer electric power bars and that can hold a magnifier and double bowl holder. These auxiliary tables will save space and ultimately time having your products and equipment within reach.",n
593,492,div,,n
597,593,h4,Steamer,y
603,593,p,"I still love steam and feel it is a piece of equipment that falls into the basic needs category. It is part of the client experience and improves circulation, dilates blood vessels, and softens blackheads making them easier to remove. Choose a model that offers a directional and adjustable head and arm, ozone, adjustable height, integrated system for essential oils, security thermostat, no drip nozzle and a simplified filling and draining system. It’s nice if there is a silent timer, automatic shut off and 3 levels of steam.",n
615,492,div,,n
619,615,h4,Hot Towel Cabi Warmer,y
625,615,p,"Hot towels are a must! Choose a towel warmer that is fully metal and that can hold at least 12 towels, keeps a constant temperature and offers a UV light. As with all electrical equipment, choose a company that certifies all electronics inside the equipment are up to standards, not dangerous and will not catch on fire. Electric certification is so important, yet many equipment imports will not get this certification. So double check that your company has this certification. You will invest so much into building your brand, image and education; you need to invest in quality equipment as well!",n
637,492,div,,n
641,637,h4,Wax Heater,y
647,637,p,I suggest you invest in a double wax warmer. Ultimately most estheticians like to have a lukewarm strip wax and a hard wax ready to go at all times. Once again choose a company with electrical certification. I like double wax warmers that have dual precise thermostats and independent temperature control.,n
660,303,h2,What Brand Should You Buy?,n
672,303,div,,n
675,672,div,,n
677,675,p,"California Skincare Supply has distributed Equipro Esthetic Equipment for 30 years. We have been honored to be their distributor for many reasons, the main reason being quality.",n
681,675,p,"Spa equipment made by Equipro has a 15-to-20-year life expectancy compared to equipment manufactured overseas that come with a 1-to-5-year life expectancy. In fact, 65% of new purchases from Equipro are from customers that have had bad experiences with spa equipment purchased from overseas. This is where it becomes crucial to have a company who you can count on.",n

703,688,div,Read More,n
706,688,div,"""I bought cheap mag lamps in the beginning. Hey a girl’s got to do what she’s got to do starting out. I was not going to go cheap on my skincare products so I had to give in on some of my equipment- which in the long run ended up costing me more. When I started becoming more efficient with my skincare services I learned fast that I needed a better quality mag lamp. By this time I didn’t need to ask questions because I was already familiar with Equipro and their quality. I just asked Kelli to order me a mag lamp, no questions asked, no price needed because I knew she had my back. To my surprise the price of the mag lamp was very, very reasonable, again why didn’t I start here first? Now with Covid, it’s sleek design and quality material stands being wiped down from head to toe before and after each client.”",n
709,672,div,,n
713,709,p,Pay a little more but save a lot!,n
715,709,p,The return on investment with Equipro is what makes Equipro Spa Equipment so valuable. You can easily double the lifetime of your equipment and reduce any problems by at least 50% by paying 5% – 15% more than a similar product imported from overseas.,n
718,709,h4,Equipro is built to last so you’re always up and running.,n
720,709,p,"Equipro’s equipment is better quality, and is not mass produced. They make one piece of equipment at a time and do not rely on other manufactures for parts. Their metal is thicker, their engines are German made, and hydraulics are Italian made. All the electrical components are CSA and UL approved and all equipment is manufactured in Montreal, Canada.",n
722,709,p,"Equipro promises that if a piece of equipment is discontinued, which rarely happens, they will continue to replace parts for up to 20 years. Equipro does not sell on Amazon.",n
725,709,h4,A 24 or 7 365 emergency hotline! And a loaner should it ever go down!,n
727,709,p,"Equipro offers a two-year warranty on most of their esthetic equipment, a loaner service, after-sale service and a 24 or 7, 365 days a year telephone emergency line.",n
729,709,p,"With Equipro’s innovation, design and high technology standards, we are able to achieve our goal to satisfy the needs of our clientele with quality, dependable products.",n
