550,540,li,Very interesting! I am going to try this. Thank you!,n
563,540,li,Thanks,n
576,540,li,This looks pretty straight-forward. One of these days I’d love to give it a try! Thanks for the info!!,n
589,540,li,"Like the author said, before making soap get a good book and read more about. These instructions over simplify things. Soap making is not difficult but potentially very dangerous. You must know what you are doing when using lye. This is not something to do with small children around. I always keep a spay bottle of vinegar out in case of accidents because vinegar neutralizes lye. If using a mixer it should be a stick blender that can be fully immersed in in the soap mixture so that the mixture is not splattering everywhere. There are two different types of lye. Sodium hydroxide is most commonly used and what I assume this recipe calls for. Potassium hydroxide is the type you would be able to make from wood ash. Sodium Hydroxide makes a hard soap and potassium hydroxide makes liquid soap. Making and using potassium hydroxide is on my to do list and I will be ordering the book recommended by the author. Lastly learning from a basic recipe is good but if the SHTF I think coconut oil, palm oil, olive oil etc… are going to be hard to come by, at least in my area, so I would recommend having a good lard or tallow soap recipe available.",n
602,540,li,"You are very right about stressing the safety issues when using lye. Like all chemicals used in the home, saftey should be number one, but it is not something to be afraid of and hopefully not prevent someone from trying soap making. Good point also on the listed ingredients being a problem to find if the SHTF. A lard recipe is very important to have on hand. There is, among many others, a good and simple lard recipe in the book listed above. I personally prefer to make a lard or tallow soap because it is a byproduct of animal husbandry and something we have an abundance of here. However, I find some people are a little uncomfortable using animal fat and wold be less inclined to try soap making because of it. As soap making is a skill that needs to be mastered, any recipe that peaks ones interest is a good recipe to start with. That way when SHTF a person is skilled enough to make a soap from the local resources available. Thanks for your insight and added information.",n
615,540,li,Another important SHTF consideration is you would have a commodity with which you can barter for other things you need.,n
628,540,li,Clifty Creek Soap you are so right. Soap is very important in maintaining and preventing the spread of disease and will be a very difficult commodity to get if SHTF. Plus it keeps well so having some stored for even short-term emergencies is a good idea.,n
641,540,li,"In the 80’s I started making soap. The oils like coconut and even olive oil weren’t as common as they are today so I just followed directions on the back of the Red Devil Lye can. I have used beef tallow lard from pigs and I had a goat that stopped breeding and got really fat so I used that. I liked lard best for laundry and goat for in the shower, because lard has a lower melting point so it would dissolve better and rinse cleaner. The goat fat is very hard and doesn’t dissolve easily in the shower.",n
654,540,li,Dell that is great information to know about the different animal fats. Thank you,n
658,540,li,,n
667,658,p,Is the measurements by weight or volume? I’m going to assume weight…,n
681,658,li,"Yes, weight.",n
694,540,li,"@Unexpected Farm Girl. Yes, rendered animal fats can be used but if one wanted to use vegetable hard fats, any brand of generic shortening, crisco-type fats can be used, costs very little one can makes about 3 batches and really works well and makes a creamy lather. One brand I use has palm oil in it anyways and is good for soapmaking but any hydrogenated fat will work.",n
