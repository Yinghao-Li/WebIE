31,28,text,The Best Sewing Supplies,n
33,5,p,"I learned to sew when I was 12 years old. My journey began Christmas morning, 1970, when I received a humble Singer sewing machine alongside a wicker sewing basket filled with a pair of Gingher scissors, a seam ripper, needles, a yellow tape measure, and a few other notions. I was fortunate because my mother and grandmothers were all seasoned sewists thrilled to help me get started on my sewing adventure.",n
38,5,p,Not everyone comes from a sewing family and choosing sewing supplies can be as daunting as sewing itself.,n
43,5,p,"Do you know how much you should spend on supplies? What supplies are best for a beginner? Are there particular brands you should buy? If you’re wanting to learn to sew but have no idea what supplies you need to get started, then look no further. I’ve put together a few must-have sewing supplies for beginners.",n

As a sewing beginner, you may want to keep a plastic storage box with your sewing supplies hidden away from family members who will snatch those scissors and use them to cut everything in site.",n

725,5,p,Occasionally you will need to make a mark on your fabric to show where darts or other features will be placed. There are a few options which will depend on the fabric and type of project you’re sewing. Water soluble markers are very good for marking things like buttons and buttonholes. Tailor’s chalk is very cost effective and comes in several colors. Tracing paper is also a good way to mark fabric.,n
