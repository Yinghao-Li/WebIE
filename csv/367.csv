1081,1077,h2,Frequently asked questions,n
1083,1077,h3,What routine should I follow,n
1085,1077,p,"If your skin is dry, focus your routine on hydration and building a healthy skin barrier . Follow the steps above but swap out products that may be too harsh or acidic for those that add moisture to your skin and help it retain that moisture.",n
1089,1077,h3,What is a basic skin care routine?,n
1091,1077,p,"A basic skin care routine has fewer steps than an expanded one but keeps your skin clean and healthy. The steps can depend on your needs and the amount of time you have. Usually, a basic routine includes removing makeup, cleansing your face, applying a spot treatment for any blemishes, using sunblock during the day, and putting on moisturizer.",n
1095,1077,h3,At what age should you start a skin care routine?,n
1097,1077,p,It’s never too early — or late — to start a skin care routine. Even kids can practice taking care of their skin by washing their faces when they wake up and before bed and applying sunscreen during the day.,n
1099,1077,p,"But, choose the steps and specific products in your routine for your skin concerns and age. Adolescents, for example, may need a routine built on products to help manage blemishes and oily skin. Adults may focus more on products that support their skin as it ages. Build a routine that’s right for you.",n
