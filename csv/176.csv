Contemporary cheerleading features exciting stunts and tricks that captivate audiences across the nation, and has even sparked a trend for cheerleading movies, camps, and blogs.

133,129,span,National Cheer Safety Foundation,n
135,129,span,"reports that roughly 93 percent of cheerleading injuries occur on hard gym flooring, concrete, or on surfaces that are not adequately covered by supportive mats or crash pads. Many of these injuries happen while a squad is performing or practicing stunts, like pyramids, shoulder sits, basket tosses, or other stunts involving a flyer, without proper cheerleading equipment. Since stunting is becoming more popular, it’s crucial that teams use appropriate AirTrack or mats during training in order to prevent injury. How to decide what type of flooring equipment is needed? Start by considering the difficulty of the stunt, and then consider the height at which the stunt is performed. Stunts performed at a higher range equal a greater risk, thus a greater need for protective mats and floors.",n

A folding floor mat is also a great option and can often be customized to your cheer team’s colors. Opt for an option that is made with good quality foam and durable vinyl; it may require a greater investment upfront, but will last for several seasons. Cheerleaders can use this equipment to more safely practice tumbling while on the road, or in an outdoor setting. While it’s not advised to attempt stunting or tumbling outside of a supervised setting, enthusiasts can practice the basics at home knowing that they have a greater level of protection and joint support on the mat.",n
