50,9,p,A Moisturizer,y
53,9,p,Just about every makeup artist out there will tell you how important it is for the skin to be properly moisturized before you begin applying any makeup.,n
56,9,p,"Hydrating your face will prevent your makeup from clumping up in dry areas, or seeping in to any fine lines and wrinkles.",n
59,9,p,Wondering if you need to use a moisturizer if you already use a primer?,n
62,9,p,"Yes, definitely. Using a moisturizer first will ensure that your primer application is more even, giving you a flawless finish.",n
68,9,p,A Face Primer,y
74,9,p,"Face primers are designed to smooth away any imperfections, making fine lines, wrinkles and enlarged pores so much less visible.",n
78,9,p,"Many primers also contain additional benefits, such as reflective ingredients to give your skin some extra radiance, or SPF for sun protection.",n
80,9,p,"When using a primer, make sure that you give it a few minutes to soak into your skin and properly set before continuing on with the rest of your makeup routine.",n

117,9,p,"If you plan on using the kit on other people, then you will need a variety of different shades and formulas. A cream palette can often be the easiest way to go, because these contain different shades, work with almost all skin types, and are very compact.",n
126,9,p,Concealers,y
130,9,p,You should have at least two concealers in your makeup kit.,n
133,9,p,"The first should be a concealer for the face, meaning that its shade should match the foundation that you are putting into your makeup kit.",n
136,9,p,"You should also add in an under-eye concealer. These will feature gentler formulas that are suited for the delicate skin around your eyes. They are ideal for brightening up the eye area, making it easier to apply the rest of your makeup.",n
141,9,p,A Loose Powder,y
145,9,p,The foundation and concealer are usually the first makeup products that are applied to the face.,n

182,9,p,"Just a small amount of highlighter can completely transform a face, so long as you apply it in the right areas.",n

227,9,p,"This should be applied on whichever parts of the skin you are planning on applying an eyeshadow. While this is usually the lids, adding a small dab of primer underneath your eye can be useful if you are going to be adding some color to the skin below your lash line.",n
231,9,li,An Eyeshadow Palette,y
235,9,p,"While there is nothing wrong with putting a few solo shadow shades into your makeup kit, an eyeshadow palette gives you more variety when it comes to choosing a shade and finish .",n
