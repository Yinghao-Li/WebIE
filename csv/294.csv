232,230,p,"Building your first professional DJ setup can be a daunting task, especially if you are simply starting out as a DJ. To start on your journey to great beat mixes, it is important to consider numerous components before making any gear purchases.",n
234,230,p,"With so many options for DJ equipment and software platforms nowadays, making informed decisions on which equipment to spend your hard-earned money on is a key step to building a professional DJ setup fit for your budget and skills. In this guide we walk you through what equipment you’ll need for your dj setup so you can feel confident in your purchases.",n
238,230,h2,DJ Setups?,n
240,230,p,"There are several types of DJ setups you can choose from when first starting out. Some are streamlined and require less equipment than others. For the smallest possible setup, you can get started with just a laptop and the right software. Other simple options include using only two turntables and a mixer.",n
242,230,p,"You can upgrade either of those setups by adding a laptop with a DJ interface package for additional effects and options. For even greater flexibility, consider adding a DJ controller to your kit for built-in turntables, sliders, pads, and other controls. If you plan to work from MP3s rather than CDs or vinyl, you can get away with a small kit that features a laptop, a controller, an audio interface, and software.",n

272,230,h4,Turntables,y
274,230,p,"Vinyl turntables are the classic choice for a DJ setup, letting you incorporate plenty of classic tracks and achieve that authentic scratch sound. But vinyl is bulky and more expensive than the other options.",n

It is one of the most important tools for determining the right timing to play songs rhythmically. When shopping for headphones as a DJ, you’ll want to consider 3 things: Accuracy in the low end, rotating ear cups, and good isolation.",n
420,230,p,"The equipment you use is based on your preference, but it’s also important to consider comfort as one of the main factors in choosing your headphones.

798,230,h2,Rent or Buy?,n
800,230,p,Renting DJ equipment is the best option for DJs who do not have the budget to purchase all the gear they need. This is particularly advantageous for those who are just starting out in developing their skills as a DJ and may not want to invest a large amount on professional equipment until they feel more confident in their skills and are ready to start booking gigs.,n
802,230,p,"Aside from saving on the cost of purchasing new gear, you won’t have to worry about performing regular maintenance on the equipment. Another advantage of renting is that you will be able to try out different brands and see which ones you like best before taking the plunge and buying the gear you want.",n
804,230,p,"On the other hand, buying brand new decks and mixers has its advantages. Aside from allowing you to create a fully customized DJ setup that suits your needs, most equipment usually come with manufacturer’s warranties. The obvious downside is the price, but if you are serious about your craft, it is definitely a worthwhile investment.",n
