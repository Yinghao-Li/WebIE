337,329,span,"to do so. Kitchen ovens don’t get hot enough to fire pottery. You can always pit fire clay at home, but it’s quite complicated to set it up and even more difficult to achieve the specific temperature needed for specific kinds of clay. If it’s too hot your clay will melt and if it’s not hot enough it won’t dry properly.",n

The evenheat is fantastic. I ordered one with the tap controller, not sure how it compares to the other options because this is the first time I’ve got to use a furnace for heat treating. Prior to this I was only using forge treatable steels, primarily O1. Looking forward to testing some stainless blades soon. Personally I’d rather make carbon blades, but a lot of my customers have been asking for stainless. Overall I would recommend you buy your knife heat treating furnace here.",n
