40,38,h2,Figure Skating Bag - Beginners,n
42,38,p,Make sure you have everything you need when you get to the ice rink. It’s a good idea to go through your figure skating bag at least once a month to remove accumulated “stuff”. Some of it will be trash and some of it might be important like flyers about upcoming events or registration forms. Here's a list of items that should be in your figure skating bag:,n
46,38,ul,,n
48,46,li,Your ice skates.,n

54,46,li,Blade covers or soakers,y
