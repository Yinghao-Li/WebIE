Your invitations should include the party's date, time, location as well as a way to RSVP. Feel free to include any other special information your guests need to know, like if your celebration is a sleepover or surprise. Make sure to also include a date to RSVP by so that you can accommodate all of your party guests.",n

It's never too early to brainstorm your party menu. Then, once you have your final headcount, you can finalize what you'll need to accommodate everyone on the day of your party. Also, keep in mind that some of your guests might have dietary restrictions. Having a variety of food, snacks and drinks is a great way to keep your guests full and happy.

451,447,p,"**People often ask if it is necessary to give party favors. The answer is ‘yes’ if you are planning to invite children age 4+ since, unfortunately, many older children are conditioned to expect them. However, the favor bags certainly do not need to be expensive or junk-filled. A take-home craft such as a decorated flowerpot with a seed packet or a “jewel”-encrusted treasure box can double as an activity and a favor. You can also purchase age-appropriate party favor sets.",n
