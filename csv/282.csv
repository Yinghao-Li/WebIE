158,154,text,"is a group of three related combat sports . The three disciplines in modern fencing are the foil , the épée , and the sabre ; winning points are made through the weapon's contact with an opponent. A fourth discipline, singlestick , appeared in the 1904 Olympics but was dropped after that, and is not a part of modern fencing. Fencing was one of the first sports to be played in the Olympics. Based on the traditional skills of swordsmanship , the modern sport arose at the end of the 19th century, with the Italian school having modified the historical European martial art of classical fencing , and the French school later refining the Italian system. There are three forms of modern fencing, each of which uses a different kind of weapon and has different rules; thus the sport itself is divided into three competitive scenes: foil, épée, and sabre. Most competitive fencers choose to specialize in one weapon only.",n

448,19,p,"Basic conventions were collated and set down during the 1880s by the French fencing master Camille Prévost. It was during this time that many officially recognised fencing associations began to appear in different parts of the world, such as the Amateur Fencers League of America was founded in 1891, the Amateur Fencing Association of Great Britain in 1902, and the Fédération Nationale des Sociétés d’Escrime et Salles d’Armes de France in 1906.",n

506,19,div,Main article,n
509,19,p,"The foil is a light thrusting weapon with a maximum weight of 500 grams. The foil targets the torso, but not the arms or legs. The foil has a small circular hand guard that serves to protect the hand from direct stabs. As the hand is not a valid target in foil, this is primarily for safety. Touches are scored only with the tip; hits with the side of the blade do not register on the electronic scoring apparatus . Touches that land outside the target area stop the action, but are not scored. Only a single touch can be awarded to either fencer at the end of a phrase. If both fencers land touches within a close enough interval of milliseconds to register two lights on the machine, the referee uses the rules of ""right of way"" to determine which fencer is awarded the touch, or if an off-target hit has priority over a valid hit, in which case no touch is awarded. If the referee is unable to determine which fencer has right of way, no touch is awarded.",n
517,19,h3,Épée,y
522,19,div,Valid épée targets,n
525,19,div,Main article,n
528,19,p,"The épée is a thrusting weapon like the foil, but heavier, with a maximum total weight of 775 grams. In épée, the entire body is a valid target. The hand guard on the épée is a large circle that extends towards the pommel, effectively covering the hand, which is a valid target in épée. Like foil, all hits must be with the tip and not the sides of the blade. Hits with the side of the blade do not register on the electronic scoring apparatus . As the entire body is legal target, there is no concept of an off-target touch, except if the fencer accidentally strikes the floor, setting off the light and tone on the scoring apparatus. Unlike foil and sabre, épée does not use ""right of way"", simultaneous touches to both fencers, known as “double touches.” However, if the score is tied in a match at the last point and a double touch is scored, the point is null and void.",n
531,19,h3,Sabre,y
536,19,div,Valid sabre targets,n
539,19,div,Main article,n
542,19,p,"The sabre is a light cutting and thrusting weapon that targets the entire body above the waist, except the weapon hand. Sabre is the newest weapon to be used. Like the foil, the maximum legal weight of a sabre is 500 grams. The hand guard on the sabre extends from hilt to the point at which the blade connects to the pommel. This guard is generally turned outwards during sport to protect the sword arm from touches. Hits with the entire blade or point are valid. As in foil, touches that land outside the target area are not scored. However, unlike foil, these off-target touches do not stop the action, and the fencing continues. In the case of both fencers landing a scoring touch, the referee determines which fencer receives the point for the action, again through the use of ""right of way"".",n

550,19,h3,Protective clothing,y
552,19,p,"Most personal protective equipment for fencing is made of tough cotton or nylon .

737,19,p,"A set of electric fencing equipment is required to participate in electric fencing. Electric equipment in fencing varies depending on the weapon with which it is used in accordance. The main component of a set of electric equipment is the body cord . The body cord serves as the connection between a fencer and a reel of wire that is part of a system for electrically detecting that the weapon has touched the opponent. There are two types: one for épée , and one for foil and sabre .",n
749,19,p,"Épée body cords consist of two sets of three prongs each connected by a wire. One set plugs into the fencer's weapon, with the other connecting to the reel. Foil and sabre body cords have only two prongs on the weapon side, with the third wire connecting instead to the fencer's lamé. The need in foil and sabre to distinguish between on and off-target touches requires a wired connection to the valid target area.",n
751,19,p,"A body cord consists of three wires known as the A, B, and C lines. At the reel connector The B pin is in the middle, the A pin is 1.5 cm to one side of B, and the C pin is 2 cm to the other side of B. This asymmetrical arrangement ensures that the cord cannot be plugged in the wrong way around.",n
753,19,p,"In foil, the A line is connected to the lamé and the B line runs up a wire to the tip of the weapon. The B line is normally connected to the C line through the tip. When the tip is depressed, the circuit is broken and one of three things can happen:",n

Grounded strips are particularly important in Épée, as without one, a touch to the floor registers as a valid touch .",n
771,19,p,"In Sabre, similarly to Foil, the A line is connected to the lamé, but both the B and C lines are connected to the body of the weapon. Any contact between the one's B or C line and the opponent's A line results in a valid touch.

Others are used defensively, to protect against a hit or obtain the right of way.",n
821,19,p,"The attacks and defences may be performed in countless combinations of feet and hand actions. For example, fencer A attacks the arm of fencer B, drawing a high outside parry; fencer B then follows the parry with a high line riposte. Fencer A, expecting that, then makes his own parry by pivoting his blade under fencer B's weapon , putting fencer B's tip off target and fencer A now scoring against the low line by angulating the hand upwards.",n

885,875,text,tournaments in the US and the BUCS fencing championships in the United Kingdom.,n
888,19,p,,n
889,888,text,National fencing organisations have set up programmes to encourage more students to fence. Examples include the Regional Youth Circuit program,n
892,888,text,in the US and the Leon Paul Youth Development series in the UK.,n
893,19,p,,n
894,893,text,"In recent years, attempts have been made to introduce fencing to a wider and younger audience, by using foam and plastic swords, which require much less protective equipment. This makes it much less expensive to provide classes, and thus easier to take fencing to a wider range of schools than traditionally has been the case. There is even a competition series in Scotland – the Plastic-and-Foam Fencing FunLeague",n

Schools organise matches directly against one another and school age pupils can compete individually in the British Youth Championships.",n

911,910,text,"Other variants include wheelchair fencing for those with disabilities, chair fencing, one-hit épée and the various types of non-Olympic competitive fencing.",n
920,910,text,"Chair fencing is similar to wheelchair fencing, but for the able bodied. The opponents set up opposing chairs and fence while seated; all the usual rules of fencing are applied. An example of the latter is the American Fencing League : the format of competitions is different and the right of way rules are interpreted in a different way. In a number of countries, school and university matches deviate slightly from the FIE format. A variant of the sport using toy lightsabers earned national attention when ESPN2 acquired the rights to a selection of matches and included it as part of its ""ESPN8: The Ocho"" programming block in August 2018.",n
