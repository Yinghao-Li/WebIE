12,4,p,"Using the right river fishing gear can improve your success on the rivers. The river fishing gear that I recommend is guide tested and used by thousands of anglers. When it comes to river fishing gear you will need rods and reels, lines, waders, jackets, vests, nets, and all the river fishing tools.",n
19,4,p,If I recommend any river fishing gear you can be sure that I have used it or that I know other guides or anglers that have both tested it and proven that it’s a good product.,n
21,4,p,"What makes a product a good product is that it needs to do the job it was intended to do and it needs to do it well. It also needs to be durable, competitively priced, and come from a company that stands behind its products and has good customer service.",n
23,4,p,The last thing you want is to buy a pair of waders that leak on your third trip and then you need to deal with a company that doesn’t want to help you out.,n

441,4,p,The downside to metal studs on your boots is that they will make more noise on the rocks and that could spook very cautious trout. These are reasons why I like the Korkers boots and the option to change my soles for the many different rivers that I fish and guide on.,n

614,4,p,"I personally wear a hip pack like the one in the picture because I carry enough gear in my pack for 10 guys and my pack can be really heavy at times. Because of that, I find that if I put all that river fishing gear into a chest pack or a sling pack or a vest, it weighs down on my shoulders and my lower back and they start to ache after a long day on the river.",n
616,4,p,The hip packs can be easily pulled to the front for easy access and then pushed to the side or around the back to get out of the way.,n
618,4,p,"When I owned my tackle shop I tried out about 12 packs to see which ones I liked the most. I found that some chest packs got in my way when casting, and some blocked my view of the path near my feet which is dangerous, and because the chest packs were so high up on my chest I found it awkward finding stuff in it.",n
624,4,p,"I like to oversize my hip pack so I like the bigger ones. It’s easier to get your hands in them and easier to get your tools and boxes in and out of a bigger pack. I like packs that open up wader too, it just makes access to what you need easier.",n

633,4,p,"For big gut guys, some hip packs can also sit below your gut, and therefore your gut may obstruct your view making finding gear difficult so this type of pack may not be a good option for you.

814,4,h2,Hats For River Fishing,y
816,4,p,"A really river hat will protect your neck, ears, and face from too much sun exposure but there is one more big advantage to wearing a hat on the river.",n
819,4,p,"For me, the primary reason I wear a hat is that it keeps the sun out of my eyes and that allows me to read the water better and enables me to see things that my clients without hats can’t see well.",n
822,4,p,"For me as a guide and for you as an angler, this is really important and is why I always wear a hat when fishing.",n
824,4,p,Baseball type hats are good for keeping the sun out of your eyes but they are not so good for covering and protecting your ears and neck from the sun.,n
825,4,p,,n
827,825,strong,The best hats for river fishing are the Cowboy style hats or Tilly hats as seen in the picture above.,n

840,4,h2,Clip-on Magnifiers,y
847,4,div,,n
849,847,p,I get asked about my clip-on magnifiers all the time. They make tying small tippets and small flies much easier.,n
851,847,p,"If you have problems tying very small flies onto very small tippets and you do not want to always reach into a pocket to grab glasses, this is a great option.",n
858,4,div,,n
860,858,p,I use the Orvis Flip Focals which you can get at Amazon HERE . I think to avoid problems it’s important to get good magnifiers.,n
866,858,p,The issue with these types of magnifiers that anglers sometimes complain about is getting clear vision out of both lenses.,n
868,858,p,Some of the cheaper magnifiers are not durable and may not work as well as other better versions. The pair that I’m wearing in the picture above are over 10 years old and still work great.,n
875,4,p,"If you find that one eye is blurry and the other is perfect, your magnifiers are not aligned properly on your hat. You may need to move them closer or further and from side to side until you get a clear view from both eyes.",n
877,4,p,I’m also not opposed to going with a very strong magnifier strength.,n
880,4,h2,Polarized Glasses Are Essential River Fishing Gear,y
887,4,div,,n
890,887,p,"Polarized glasses cut the glare on the water and help you see the fish, the structure, the snags, holes or pockets, the river bottom, as well as things you could trip on when crossing the river, and they will also help you see your floats or flies better.",n
892,887,p,I couldn’t guide or fish as well without my fishing glasses which I why I would consider them to be an essential part of your fly fishing gear.,n
899,4,p,Not only that but they protect your eyes from the sun and from stray hooks.,n
901,4,p,I prefer glasses like the ones on my hat which are tight wrap-around style glasses that block out more light. Blocking out more light allows me to see deeper into the water to see all those fish holding spots and more. A combination of the glasses and a good hat is a must-have on the river.,n
903,4,p,I wear darker grey lenses during high bright sun and prefer the brown or amber lenses during low light times.,n
905,4,p,Higher-end glasses like the Oakley Fuel Cell Polarized Sunglasses will work better than cheaper glasses.,n

921,4,div,,n
923,921,p,"A good sun shirt should have a hood, be lightweight, and be SPF50 or more. It should be thin enough that a light breeze will go through it to keep you cool and it should blend into the background.",n
925,921,p,The AFTCO Hooded Performance Long-Sleeve Shirt was designed by a pro angler for anglers. You can check out this fishing sun shirt and some others at Bass Pro Shop – HERE .,n
936,4,p,The Columbia Terminal Deflector Zero Long-Sleeve Hoodie is designed for summer fishing and has the added thumbholes to keep the tops of your hands covered. This shirt doesn’t come in green color but the blue blend into the sky and the tan color is not bad either. You can also get it at Cabelas.,n

954,4,div,,n
956,954,p,"Face and neck protection has become popular with river anglers. Call them buffs, face guards, or gaiters they are all basically the same.",n
958,954,p,This Fish Monkey Flare Performance Face Guard from Bass Pro Shops is a ventilated mouth gaiter. The vented mouth prevents your breath from fogging up sunglasses and just makes it more comfortable to breathe. Not an essential part of river fishing gear but still nice to have.,n
963,4,h2,Sun Gloves and Winter Gloves,n
970,4,div,,n
972,970,p,I prefer sun gloves over sunblock because sunblock can make my hands slippery when holding and casting my fishing rod.,n
974,970,p,I also believe the smell of sunblock on your hands can get onto your flies or bait and that can prevent fish from biting.,n
976,970,p,If you want to try sun gloves consider these Buff Aqua+ Glove Fishing Gloves from Bass Pro Shops,n
980,4,p,Winter gloves are an essential part of your fishing gear in cold weather. Some winter gloves suck for fishing because they make fishing very difficult. You want to get good gloves that are designed for winter fishing.,n

1001,999,p,A good wading staff is something you should consider if you are not very stable on your feet or if crossing faster rivers are hard for you. It’s amazing how much extra support and balance and good fold-up wading staff can provide.,n
1003,999,p,"The best wading staffs are over $100.00 but they are lightweight, packable, and won’t break on you halfway across the river.",n
1005,4,p,For the best wading staff look at the SIMMS wading staff at Bass Pro Shops or the Orvis Ripcord Wading Staff at FishUSA.com.,n

1343,1342,text,Hi Graham I have a 13ft medium moderate 8-17lb Luhr Jensen Legacy float rod but I find it to heavy when using smaller 4-7 gram floats for steelhead. I find I don’t have control when casting or managing the line. I was thinking about getting a 13ft raven im8 but someone said that I should go with an even lighter rod for steelhead. I normally fish the Nottawasaga and some other mid sized rivers. I know you guide with the IM8 but I just wanted to see what you would recommend for a strictly steelhead rod around $300 or less.,n
