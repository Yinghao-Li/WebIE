56,53,p,"Hi Everyone! After seeing the ongoing comments about what ink, nibs, pens I use in my Instagram posts, I’ve decided to make an official blog post that lists all of my favourite calligraphy supplies, to date. Unlike my beginner’s guide, which primarily covers the basic materials to get you started in calligraphy, this list is more based on MY personal preferences and experiences. So it’s important that you spend the time to try out different supplies and see what works best for yourself as well.",n
58,53,p,"I will include links to websites you can buy the supplies from. However, do note that many of these materials can be accessed in many different stores depending on your location, so have a browse online before placing that order! (;",n
61,53,p,Nibs,n
64,53,p,"Let’s start with one of the most commonly asked materials, nibs. There are so hundreds of options and I love to explore as many different types of nibs as I can. I have recently fell into the world of vintage nibs, so I will also cover that a little bit. Contemporary nibs are quite easy to access and there are a list of commonly used nibs. I no longer use stiff nibs such as G nibs as I have developed a light hand for writing after practicing Spencerian script and flowy modern script. Moreover, soft nibs work better on more surfaces, including delicate handmade paper.",n
66,53,p,I have included links to Instagram videos where I used each nib!,n

123,53,p,"Now it’s time for these beautiful handcrafted tools. I absolutely love collecting pen holders, not that I have many yet though! The wooden holder in the middle is a basic wooden oblique holder while the two on either side are handmade by Huy Hoang Dao . I have also recently ordered a beautiful resin holder made by Luis Creations and I can’t wait to show you guys. Functionality is a different story however, while custom made holders can be jaw-dropingly beautiful, I use my $23 wooden oblique holder just as much as the other two. A few features to take note on when purchasing new pen holders, other than aesthetics, are:",n

Forget the laboratory magnetic stirrers, this one is certainly a calligrapher’s statement piece. It is designed by the Australian Designer and Pen-maker Luis Creations . This ink stirrer is specifically designed for calligraphers so it is a light and portable battery-run magnetic stirrer with incredible aesthetics! What’s even better about it is that it comes with very tiny magnetic bars with a raised centre, allowing it to fit nicely in small ink jars and also work quietly. I am also excited to have the chance to stock some of these ‘Soap’ ink stirrers and you can find them",n
