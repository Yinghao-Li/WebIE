453,15,p,…and I have NO idea what my kid needs to get started!!”,n
455,15,p,"This is one of the most common questions I get from readers, and I’m 99% sure it’s from my blog name.",n
457,15,p,"As my name suggests, I am indeed a “soccer mom.” I grew up playing the sport all the way through high school, and my oldest daughter started last spring.",n
462,15,p,"I love soccer and I actually do have a pretty good idea of what gear kids need to play the sport. It’s been some years since I last hit the field, but the basic needs for soccer haven’t changed much.",n

468,15,h2,What to Pack in Your Soccer Bag,n
470,15,p,"The first thing I want to emphasize is that you probably don’t need as much as you think. Soccer doesn’t require a lot of expensive equipment, so it’s a very accessible sport.",n
478,15,p,"Your team or league might have specific requirements, but the following are the basics that you need to get started playing recreational youth soccer.",n

486,15,h3,Water bottle,y
488,15,p,"Hydration is the most important thing to take care of on game day! A soccer game is basically non-stop running, and if it’s warm outside your child will sweat and expend a LOT of moisture.",n
493,15,p,"Some teams might provide a water cooler, but it’s best to bring your own bottle just in case. Pack a water bottle for your player, as well as a bottle for every spectator in the family.",n
495,15,p,"Look for an insulated stainless steel water bottle — not only are they reusable, but they keep water cold for hours, even in the hot sun!",n
502,15,p,As,n
504,15,p,"It’s ok to treat your budding soccer star to a sports drink at halftime or after the game, but remember that those drinks usually contain a lot of sugar. The majority of kids’ daily hydration should come from water.",n

533,15,h3,Cleats,y
535,15,p,"While some fun leagues allow kids to play in tennis shoes, flats don’t provide much grip or support for running on grass. A good pair of soccer cleats provides traction for the fast-paced play and all weather conditions .",n
539,15,p,"Make sure you choose footwear specifically designed for soccer play Some other sports use metal cleats, but many soccer leagues don’t allow them because metal cleats tear up the field and are dangerous if a child gets kicked by them. .",n
546,15,p,"A good pair of cleats should last your child until they outgrow them, plus they offer more stability and foot protection. This is one item that is worth the splurge.",n

766,762,p,"Great tips! Having quality cleats makes a difference as well. I didnt understand the difference between the cheap and the quality until we went to a conference with the Madrid soccer team and more then one player mentioned having good foot wear, so I made the switch for my kids and husband who also plays and they have all mentioned the difference! Happy playing!",n
774,762,li,"Very true! I splurged on a pair of quality cleats in high school – they were kind of expensive, but they helped get rid of my shin splints because they offered better support. They also lasted longer!",n
