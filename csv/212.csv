Out of drag I don't even wear eyeshadow so I'm wondering, is there are product you think is important to have? I have some cream eyeshadows and some liquid glitter but I'm wondering what products I need to buy!",n

184,182,p,"a drag makeup kit, IMO:",n
185,182,ul,,n
188,185,li,1 foundation stick that matches you,n
191,185,li,1 stick thats a couple shades darker,n
194,185,li,1 stick thats a shade lighter,n
197,185,li,Coty Airspun translucent powder,n
200,185,li,Ben Nye powder in Super White,n
203,185,li,Some matte eyeshadows. The Sonia Kashuk Eye On Neutral Palette is a good palette to start with. You can also invest in Inglot magnetic single shadows if you want to make a custom eyeshadow palette.,n
210,185,li,"NYX Jumbo Eyeshadow Pencil in Milk . It works as a base that makes colored shadows more vivid. You can also use it to line your waterline. If you use it by itself, be sure to set it with a white shadow.",n
215,185,li,Almost any blush palette that doesn't kick up powder will do. Morphe and BH Cosmetics have them.,n
218,185,li,"Physicians Formula liquid liner in Ultra Black , or alternatively Inglot gel liner in #77 , but you need a brush to use it with. I use a Mac 263.",n
221,185,li,"Matte lipstick. Colourpop is your best friend. Their Matte X formula is great for drag: super matte, transfer proof, and long lasting. Best colors for drag queens: Poppin' , Trust Me , With The Band . A good three to start with. I also use Kat Von D Everlasting Liquid Lipsticks, which have a larger range of colors but are more hit-or-miss .",n
230,185,li,"At least two pencils for your brows, a light one and a dark one . They drag a lot less than an eye pencil would over set foundation.)",n
233,185,li,Maybelline Great Lash Mascara.,n
236,185,li,G l i t t e r. Superglitter cosmetic glitters are the most cost sensitive and are cosmetic grade.,n
238,182,p,"Most of my brushes are from E.L.F, which you can find at Target or CVS, or online if they aren't near you. Their brushes are 1 to 6 dollars. I have pretty much literally every brush you can get in stores. My other must-haves are the Mac 263 angled liner brush, Mac 316 lip brush, the RealTechniques stippling brush, and the RealTechniques shading brush. The Beauty Blender or the RealTechniques sponge is a godsend, it makes your foundation seamless. Just use it by getting it soaking wet and squeezing the water out. You can clean it between shades by rubbing it on some moisturizing soap and squeezing or rinsing it.",n
240,182,p,Tools that every queen should have,n
241,182,ul,,n
244,241,li,a RealTechniques sponge,y
247,241,li,a large fluffy brush,y
250,241,li,an angled fluffy brush,y
253,241,li,a small concealer brush,y
256,241,li,a thin flat brush,y
259,241,li,a flat shadow brush,y
262,241,li,a small fluffy shadow brush,y

379,145,div,,n
381,379,p,Get a good full coverage concealer and foundation. A lot of queens use kryolan or Ben Nye because they're stage makeup and they have a high concentration of pigment .,n
383,379,p,Make sure you have some good setting powder. I like to have one setting powder for each of my foundation colors and I also have a translucent one for the whole face. A lot of queens insist on using a white powder as well but not all do. That's up to you,n
385,379,p,"As far as eyeshadow, there are so many brands and types that it's all up to your taste and experiences with each product.",n
387,379,p,Finding a good highlight eyeshadow is crucial though. I do not recommend white. So many queens use white and I find that even some expensive white eyeshadows tend to look overly gray when used adjacent to darker colors.,n
389,379,p,Instead I prefer to use off-white colors,n
391,379,p,The warmer tone in the off-white doesn't get so dirty looking,n
393,379,p,"But most importantly, I have found, that even lower-end makeup can be applied beautifully with the right tools.",n
395,379,p,"Makeup doesn't have to be expensive to be good necessarily, but I would advise that you don't go cheap when looking for brushes. A good set of brushes can really make a huge difference.",n
397,379,p,"My favorite specific brushes are my foundation brush, my sharp angle brush, and my big fluffy brush. I also love to use a beauty blender in place of those little drugstore sponges",n
