598,592,p,Badminton Equipments,n
602,592,p,"Whenever you want to play badminton or want to make your career in this than it is necessary that you have to know about their important and needed badminton equipment. In this article, we cover the basic equipment and gear required for a game of badminton.",n
607,592,p,Badminton Racket,y
611,592,p,"Badminton rackets can be made from several types of materials. Depending on the material selection, this can result in different combinations of racket weight, balance points, and string tensions. With so many different combinations, it will take time to decide which is most suited to your playing style. Instead of making purchases online, go to a badminton shop. Ask for assistance and select a racket that you feel comfortable with. Swing the racket around to get a good feel for its overall weight and grip.",n
619,592,p,Shuttlecock,y
623,592,p,"There are two types of shuttlecocks available in the market - plastic and feathered shuttlecocks. Plastic shuttlecocks are far more durable compared to the feathered types which are commonly used. However, plastic shuttlecocks are only recommended for beginners who are just starting out. So if you just start to play badminton you can use this shuttle. This is because feathered shuttlecocks are expensive and fray easily especially if the wrong technique is used. Hence, plastic shuttlecocks are good for beginners to use for training. Plastic shuttlecocks tend to travel shorter distances as they are heavier. Hence, they are good for building strength as you make the transition to feathered shuttlecocks.",n
629,592,p,Badminton Shoes,y
632,592,p,,n
633,632,text,"Badminton shoes are designed to give you better traction and grip to stop in time to return a shot. They should also be lightweight have good cushioning to absorb impact when you jump or land. Regular players will find heel cups useful to prolonging the lifespan of your shoes. Do not wear jogging shoes as they usually lack grip and traction. You might end up crashing through the badminton net if you are unable to stop in time to receive a drop shot. If you want to get a good grip on your badminton shoes, only wear it on badminton courts. Do not wear it for jogging or any other activities. Once the grip is gone, the shoes will not be effective on the court anymore. If your heels and knees start to hurt every time you land heavily on the floor after jumping, it means that the cushioning of your shoes has worn off. Although your shoes may still look new, it may be time to change them. If you want them to last longer, you may have to change the insole.",n
635,632,br,"To protect your heels, it would be wise to invest in a good pair of heel cups. While they may be expensive, they are certainly worth it as they can save you from a lot of pain. Heel cups can also help to prolong the lifespan of your Badminton Shoes. If you decide to invest in them, get a good pair that comes with a lifetime guarantee.",n
641,592,p,Badminton Attire,y
645,592,p,"For casual to non-competitive players, a comfortable pair of shorts and cotton or dry-fit t-shirt is sufficient. Some players may want to equip themselves with hand grips, wristbands and ankle guards. Each of these items serves a purpose and might also add a color to the entire get-up. When it comes to badminton equipment, select what is appropriate before turning your attention to aesthetics.",n
653,592,p,Net,y
658,592,p,"A mesh net divides the badminton court into two sides. Badminton net is placed lower than a volleyball net at five feet and one inch high on the sides and five feet high in the center. The length may vary depending on whether doubles or singles are playing, with singles reaching 17 feet and doubles reaching 22 feet. The net is 30 inches wide with a 3-inch white tape doubled over the top.",n
667,592,p,These are some main equipment’s which is needed when you play badminton.,n
