As an endurance athlete, not only will you be sweating out salts and minerals and electrolytes, you will be burning through everything else fast, meaning: protein, amino acids, carbs, fats, enzymes, vitamins, minerals, hormones, anti-oxidants and stuff you’ve never even heard of. And you can’t simply replace some of these things. Your body needs the spare parts to manufacture critical chemicals. Spare your body long-term damage, by keeping it regularly fed, watered and rested. Which means minimize processed foods.",n
