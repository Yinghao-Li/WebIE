46,44,p,"Today, football is one of the most popular sports in America. But there was a time when the game was outlawed, and deemed illegal because it was considered too dangerous to play. This was long before anyone put on a helmet or a set of shoulder pads, back when football was played without any kind of protection.",n
48,44,p,"Since then, new safety equipment has been invented and the rules of the game have evolved, making it a safer sport to participate in. And even today, equipment manufacturers are still improving their products and looking to limit serious injuries like concussions with space-age enhancements to helmets and pads. Wearing proper fitting equipment can significantly reduce the incidents of injury during play.",n
50,44,p,"There is a tremendous market for football equipment, made up of many legacy companies with long histories in the game, as well as other, newer companies, set on evolving and improving on existing equipment.",n

75,44,p,"Other pieces of gear players typically wear include football pants, which are padded pants that protect the hips, thighs and knees; receivers also wear gloves to help them catch the ball while linemen use other types of hand protection. Other accessories include their uniform, neck guards, visors, arm guards, and pads.",n
77,44,h2,What pads do NFL players wear?,n
79,44,p,"Football players, from the pros down to pee-wee ball, typically all wear the same equipment. A properly outfitted tackle football player is required to wear a helmet with a face mask, a set of shoulder pads, football pants, and cleats.",n
81,44,p,"Many NFL players have reportedly been using light, flexible shoulder pads made by X-Tech . NFL players concerned about limiting head injuries have turned to a new helmet made by a company called Vicis , which has also started manufacturing youth models specially designed to cut down on concussions and similar injuries. Other brands like Ridell and Schutt are respected in the game and many players use their products as well.",n
87,44,h2,What does a youth football player need?,n

93,44,p,"Eight years after the very first football game was played between Rutgers and Princeton, a student at Princeton by the name of L.P. Smock invented the first set of shoulder pads in 1877. Players have been wearing them regularly since the early 1900s.",n
95,44,p,"Almost like body armor, shoulder pads are typically hard plastic shells on top of softer, flexible padding that allows players to run into each other, collide and tackle without more serious and frequent injuries. While players still can get hurt—and often do—playing football, equipment like shoulder pads significantly limit those injuries.",n
