10,4,p,"For Shirley Lam, the founder and owner of the pet lifestyle site, Perro and Me , it’s all about building a little bit of structure. Lam, who runs the thriving online business out of her house in Vancouver, says it’s important to get in the mindset that you’re going to work. “Set your daily schedule in your calendar and stick to it as you would at the office,” she says. “And get dressed for work — do your hair, put on makeup and look office-appropriate, even if it’s just your home office.”",n

72,4,p,"Cable clutter was one of my most frequent distractions, which is why I recommend everyone gets a Bluetooth keyboard.",n
74,4,p,"I recommend this one from Satechi because it has backlit keys , and the ability to pair it with multiple devices. If you want one keyboard to take between your home office and work office in a hybrid working environment, this is a huge feature.",n
76,4,p,"Satechi’s keyboard can be recharged using a USB-C cable , so you don’t have to worry about keeping a stock of batteries. We tested this keyboard, and came away by its build quality, comfort, and battery life.",n

95,4,p,The perfect complement to Satechi’s Bluetooth keyboard is Logitech’s MX Anywhere 3 Bluetooth mouse.,n
99,4,p,"The mouse is pretty small, but feels good in the hand and comfortable to use during long work sessions. Its scroll wheel moves smoothly, and its side buttons were easy to hit with a thumb in our experience. The smooth ridges on the side of the mouse give it enough grip that it won’t slip even if your palms get a little sweaty.",n
101,4,p,"The MX Anywhere 3 shares one important feature with Satechi’s Slim X2: It can be paired with multiple devices, and lets you switch between them with the press of a button. You can apply additional customization when the mouse is paired with a computer by installing Logitech’s app, which is available on MacOs and Windows.",n

126,4,p,Flexispot’s Vici Quick is a standing desk that lets you adjust its height between 28.7 inches and 48.4 inches. This wide range ensures you’ll find the level for your comfort. You can change its position by pressing the up and down arrows on a panel on the right side of the desk. You can also save specific heights into the panel’s memory for easy access.,n
134,4,p,"The Vici Quick is 48 inches long and 24 inches wide, and can hold up to 110 pounds, so you’ll have no problem fitting your computer and other accessories on top of it. If you’ve never used a standing desk before, we recommend you get a cushioned mat to make it easier on your feet.",n

157,4,p,"You can adjust its height between roughly 41.3 and 45.1 inches, and swivel it a full 360-degrees. The seat rests on wheels, so you can easily move around, too.",n
159,4,p,"This office chair had a generous amount of padding, and its slightly curved back encourages you to sit up straight. The arm rests are also comfortable, even during long computer sessions.",n

174,4,p,"Asus’s 28-Inch display has a maximum resolution of 4K, so text, images, and videos will look extremely clear. This monitor has a large screen, but its bezels are fairly small and its stand is small, so it won’t take up as much space on your desk.",n
176,4,p,"The VP28UQG supports AMD FreeSync, a technology that helps it keep up with fast action when gaming, and ASUS’s “Eye Care” feature, which slowly reduces the amount of blue light it emits. This display has two HDMI ports and one DisplayPort input, so you can hook it up to your computer with space left over for a game console .",n
180,4,p,"You can’t adjust the positioning of the monitor very much, but you can attach it to a different stand to improve its ergonomics. If you want to take comfort a step further, I recommend Mount It!’s desk mount , which gives you complete control over your display’s position.",n

You’ll get full access to these inputs by connecting the dock to your laptop’s Thunderbolt 4 port. If you have a laptop with a Thunderbolt 3 port, Anker has you covered with another dock .",n

They have a modern, classy look that’ll make your home office look more professional, but more importantly, they sound great.",n
236,4,p,"They have a 4-inch bass driver and 1-inch tweeter, which create a surprising amount of depth, and EQ controls on the back help you dial in the sound based on your preferences. If you want more bass, you can connect a subwoofer directly to the speakers.",n

263,4,p,"If you work in a noisy environment, or prefer to listen to music on headphones, your best bet is getting Bang and Olufsen’s Beoplay HXs.",n
265,4,p,"The headphones deliver excellent active noise-cancelling performance and audio quality in a relatively compact package. Bang and Olufsen says they last up to 30 hours per charge, which was consistent with our tests.",n
267,4,p,"What puts the Beoplay HXs over the top, though, is their comfort. Bang and Olufsen opted to use memory foam for their ear cups and headband, so they fit perfectly on your head. They also considered the clamping force, so you’ll never feel like the ear pads are squeezing the sides of your head.",n
275,4,p,"There are a ton of great sounding noise-cancelling over-ear Bluetooth headphones, but Bang and Olufsen’s emphasis on comfort sets the Beoplay HXs apart. It makes it easy to wear them for an entire workday without feeling like your ears are getting pinched, or your head is being weighed down.",n

294,4,p,"If you’re working from home, it means your entire day relies on a strong internet connection. I’ve had the opportunity to try several modern routers, but Linksys’ Velop MX5 has consistently come out on top.",n
296,4,p,"The tall, white router connects to the cable modem from your ISP , and creates a strong wireless network that extends up to 3,000 sq. ft. . The router supports Wi-Fi 6, the latest version of the wireless standard that’s faster, farther reaching, and more secure. Most tech isn’t built with Wi-Fi 6 yet, but all of your current devices will connect seamlessly.",n
298,4,p,"I’m recommending this router because of its rock-solid dependability, and its ease of use. I’ve never experienced any slowdown, even when over a dozen devices were connected and being actively used. Keep in mind the speeds you get will depend on the plan you’ve selected with your ISP — a fast router cannot improve a slow connection. Setting up the router took about five minutes in Linksys’ app , which can also be used to diagnose Wi-Fi problems, see which devices are on your network, or set per-device parental controls.",n

377,4,p,"The microphone is ready to use once it’s plugged in, but you can make adjustments to its sound in a couple of ways. You can manage the mic’s gain and the volume of audio going to its headphone jack by swiping your finger on a touch-sensitive ring located around the center of the microphone.",n
379,4,p,"If you want to adjust more advanced settings, you’ll need to download Shure’s MOTIV Desktop app , which gives you fine-grain controls over its sound. Either way, Shure’s M7V is a great sounding microphone that’s easy to setup, an intuitive to use.",n
