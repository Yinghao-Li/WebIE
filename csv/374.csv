421,164,p,Sketching allows you to strengthen your muscle memory for movements that are actually quite different from writing – where movements are very small and employ a different combination of muscle groups.,n

435,164,p,"Pick up a quality ‘drawing’ paper that is thick, sturdy and well textured . My recommendations will be down below.",n
437,164,p,"As for pencils, you’ll need a set that can give you a good range of values if you want to produce realistic portraits.",n

452,164,p,Things to remember,n

455,453,li,Hard pencils are better for sketching because they don’t smudge as easily as soft ones. Shading dark areas of a portrait can damage the paper or even puncture it.,n

543,164,p,"When you’re making preliminary guidelines for your artwork, you’ll want to use a transparent ruler. An opaque one will block your full view of the drawing which may lead to uneven lines that you will need to erase and re-draw.",n
