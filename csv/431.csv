76,74,p,The majority of people who start a soap making business began their venture with a hobby. They enjoyed making homemade soap for family and friends.,n
78,74,p,"If you’re ready to get serious about making soap as a business, you’ll have to up your game.",n
80,74,p,Here’s some business advice – you’ll have to spend focus on the business end when you start selling. Soap makers wish they could spend all their time making soaps but should spend the majority of their time working on ways to sell soap.,n
83,74,h2,Why You Should Consider Starting a Soap Business,n
84,74,ol,,n
86,84,li,"Soap making is fun. You can be creative with molds, ingredients, scents and colors.",n
88,84,li,You can start your soap making business at home.,n
90,84,li,It’s not expensive to get started making handmade soap.,n
92,84,li,soap formulas which you can tweak.,n
94,74,h2,How Much Does It Cost to Start Your Soap Business?,n
96,74,p,"Many soap makers start small from home, with a minimal product line at a cost of about $1,000. You most likely have some basic equipment needed for a small operation, such as a microwave, blender and mixing kettle. You can save money using equipment you already have.",n
98,74,p,"Soap making can be done two ways – cold process or hot process. With both, the basics are the same – you mix an alkali with fats or oils. Just as it sounds, with the hot process you cook the soap, which makes it easier to add scents and colors. Most soap companies use that process.",n
100,74,p,"You’ll need better equipment to turn out larger batches. Expect to spend from $14,000 to $28,000 starting a soap making business. That number varies depending on whether you can start from home or need to rent or buy space.",n
106,74,h2,Starting a Soap Making Business in 20 Simple Steps,n
108,74,h3,Research the Competition,n
110,74,p,"There are many other soap makers already in the business. Before you start your own soap making business, you need to learn who they are, what they make and where they sell.",n
112,74,p,Also consider the competition you’ll get from the manufacturers making commercial soaps for the big box stores. Acknowledge that people can buy soap very cheaply. How is yours going to be so special that they’ll spend more to get it?,n
114,74,h3,Choose a Niche,n
116,74,p,"Choosing your niche and knowing your target market are closely related. It’s important to realize that just because you absolutely love a certain soap you make, doesn’t mean there’s a market ready for you.",n
118,74,p,"Today, small businesses specializing in homemade soap making are focusing on using natural ingredients, which is just what the consumers want. To your natural soaps you can add tweaks in the manufacturing process that make your handcrafted soap unique – such as embossing it, adding specific herbs, mixing in essential oils or coconut oil.",n
124,74,h3,Know Your Target Market,n
126,74,p,your business in online stores?,n
128,74,p,"Most businesses, not just soap making, carefully consider the demographics for their buyers. To be a successful soap maker, you’ll need to do a mix of both – sell local and via an online store on the web.",n
133,74,h3,Name and Brand Your Business,n
135,74,p,"Make sure the name you take isn’t already taken, or very similar to another business that makes homemade soaps.",n
137,74,p,"Also, be careful not to limit yourself as your business grows, because of the name you’ve chosen. For example, “Linda’s Lavender Luxury Bars” doesn’t allow Linda to expand to other scents.",n
146,74,p,"Your logo you design is extremely important. It will most likely be stamped or printed on your shipping materials and packaging. It should be easily recognizable, as a consistent brand with a distinct style and color.",n
148,74,h3,Create a Soap Making Business Plan,n
150,74,p,Every profitable business has a plan with all the features needed:,n
