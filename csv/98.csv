23,4,p,,n
25,23,strong,Oval Handle;,n

62,4,h2,The Sweet Spot,n
64,4,p,The sweet spot or the middle of the bat is the part of the bat where you are looking to strike the ball most of the time.

90,87,text,"The bat has very limited wood taken out the back of the bat, therefore the wood is left where it really matters to ensure the utmost ping. It is someone that is looking at ultimate power at the forefront, then this shape may suit. The pickup will still be nice and balanced and feel superb in the hands. This is the shape that most pro’s like especially in the ODI or T20 format due to the value for strokes you receive with this profile.",n
91,4,p,,n

Perfect for front foot players and on slow low English wickets. This bat is designed for big hitters and for clearing the ropes effortlessly.,n
99,4,p,,n
101,99,strong,Concave,n
102,99,text,"Concave sanded through the back of the blade just enough to reduce weight whilst keeping the essential depth and mass of wood through the bat’s core to ensure a featherlight pickup. Bats with a concave back profile are those that have had wood scooped out from either side of the bat's spine. Concaving is done to reduce the bat’s weight while still providing thicker edges and deeper swells, thereby improving its pick-up.",n

138,136,strong,Large Bow;,n
139,136,text,"A large bow acts as a counter-balance, raising the center of gravity of the cricket bat, thereby assisting pick-up. In other words, a bat with considerable bow and a lower middle can feel the same as a straight blade with a higher middle.",n
141,4,p,"It helps with control of strokes, as the player’s hands are positioned more in front of the ball during contact. It acts like a scoop, to produce more lofted shots, which do however run the risk of being caught.",n
