121,2,h2,Backpacking VS Trekking,n
123,2,p,"First off, I want to define the difference between backpacking, trekking, and hiking. These words are sometimes used interchangeably — but they can also have different meanings depending on who you ask.",n
124,2,p,,n
126,124,strong,Backpacking,n
127,124,text,is a hiking trip that includes overnight camping. Packing everything you need to be self-sufficient in the wilderness on your back. Like my 10-day solo backpacking trip on Greenland’s Arctic Circle Trail .,n
130,2,p,,n
132,130,strong,Trekking,n
133,130,text,"is hiking long-distance, for days or weeks at a time. You might pack everything in yourself, but more likely you’ll have a guide and pack animal or human porter to help you. You may or may not need to bring your own shelter. Like my trek in the mountains of Afghanistan with a local guide and pack horse.",n
136,2,p,,n
138,136,strong,Hiking,n
139,136,text,"is just walking on a wilderness trail through the mountains, forest, desert, or even the countryside. Generally, this is used to define day hikes that don’t require an overnight stay. Like my day hike up Ireland’s highest mountain .",n
143,2,p,"I’m going to focus on a typical 2-5 day backpacking trip, packing in your own food, water, and camping gear. But much of this will also work as a trekking packing list.",n
155,2,h2,Lightweight Backpacking Checklist,n
158,2,p,Backpacking checklists and packing lists can be a controversial subject. Everyone has an opinion about what’s the best hiking and camping gear to bring on a trip!,n
160,2,p,"You have your traditional backpackers , lightweight backpackers , and even ultra light thru-hikers who all do things differently.",n
167,2,p,,n
168,167,text,"For this backpacking gear checklist, I’m sharing my personal setup, which is considered “lightweight” with a",n
170,167,strong,20 lbs base-weight.,n
180,2,p,"Backpack base-weight is the weight of all your gear except for food, water, and fuel — which varies depending on the length and location of your trip.",n
185,2,h2,Choosing A Hiking Backpack,n
188,2,h3,Overnight Backpacks,y
190,2,p,"For multi-day hiking and backpacking, where you’ll need to carry everything in on your back, I recommend choosing a 40-65 liter backpack that will hold your tent, sleeping bag, food, water, and other backpacking essentials.",n
198,2,ul,,n
200,198,li,"Gregory Mountain Zulu 55 – This is the backpack I take with me on most 2-3 day trips. It’s super lightweight , comfortable, and well designed. The front-loading pannel makes it a great travel backpack too.",n
205,198,li,"Arc’teryx Bora 50 – For long-distance treks with the potential for more extreme weather, or more weight , I prefer this for superior weather resistance and a more comfortable hip-belt.",n
208,2,h3,Day Hiking Backpacks,y
210,2,p,"You may or may not want a day pack — it depends on the type of trip. Other than a traditional day-hike that doesn’t require camping, you might also want a day pack to wear during a guided trek, for easy access to certain items while the rest of your gear is with a porter or pack animal.",n
212,2,p,I do not bring a day pack on independent overnight hiking and camping trips.,n
213,2,ul,,n
215,213,li,Osprey Stratos 24,n
217,213,li,Arc’teryx Alpha AR 35,n
219,2,h3,Waterproofing Your Pack,y
221,2,p,"What if it rains during your backpacking trip? Most hikers bring a waterproof rain cover for their backpack, and I used to as well. Until I discovered the magic of using a trash compactor bag to line the INSIDE of my pack.",n
225,2,p,"Why? First of all, they are much cheaper. Second, they are multi-use items. Finally, they are much more effective. Sure, the outside of your backpack will still get wet, but everything inside will be bone-dry. Even if you fall into a river.",n
235,2,h2,Color-Coded Stuff Sacks,n
238,2,p,"To keep your backpack organized during your hiking adventure, I recommend using a few lightweight stuff sacks and or or packing cubes, in different colors, so it’s easy to grab important gear quickly.",n
246,2,ul,,n
248,246,li,"Sea To Summit Ultra-Sil Stuff Sack – I use a few of these in different sizes and colors for my spare clothing, cold weather gear, and more.",n
251,246,li,"Eagle Creek Specter Sacks – I also have a few of these for smaller items, like my repair kit and to store my microfiber towel.",n
255,2,h2,Tents and Overnight Shelters,y
265,2,p,"If you plan to sleep outside in the wilderness, you’re going to need a quality shelter to pack with you. Traditionally this would mean using a tent, but a camping hammock or bivy bag are other possible options. While I own and use all three types of shelters, generally I think most people should start with a tent.",n
267,2,h3,Lightweight Tents,y
269,2,p,"This is one of your most important pieces of backpacking gear. You want to find a tent that is a good combination of lightweight, spacious, waterproof, and easy to set up. It’s basically where you’ll be living during your trip!",n
270,2,ul,,n
272,270,li,"Nemo Equipment Hornet 2P – My current favorite lightweight backpacking tent if I’m on my own. Perfect for one person plus some gear, but a bit tight with two people. I use this 75% of the time.",n
275,270,li,Big Agnes Copper Spur UL2 – Another great tent I own. Slightly more room if I’m going to be sharing it with someone else.,n
280,2,p,REI Quarter Dome 2 Tent,n
282,2,h3,Camping Hammocks,y
284,2,p,"If you’re going to be camping in a forest or jungle, it might make sense to hang a hammock for your backpacking shelter. A camping hammock keeps you off the ground, away from bugs and wet conditions, but is also easy to pack with no aluminum poles. Some people prefer sleeping in them to tents also.",n
287,2,li,"Hennessy Hammock Jungle Explorer – I’ve used this camping hammock on many adventures. From hitchhiking America , canoeing the BWCA , and even exploring the jungle in Panama’s Darien Gap .",n
304,2,h2,Warm Sleeping Bag,y
306,2,p,,n
307,306,text,"For a good night’s sleep, you need a warm sleeping bag. They key is to pick a bag rated warm enough for the weather you’ll encounter on your backpacking trip. I own two sleeping bags , but if you can only get one,",n
309,306,strong,I’d probably recommend something around 15F degrees.,n
318,2,p,"Down sleeping bags are warmer with less weight, but also more expensive. Synthetic bags weigh a bit more, but are more affordable. For extreme cold weather conditions , layering two sleeping bags is ideal.",n
321,2,ul,,n
323,321,li,"Nemo Riff Down 15F or -1C – An amazing 3-season down fill bag that packs up super small, with zipper air vents for those warmer nights. Spoon shape for comfortable side sleeping. I own the 30F version of this.",n
326,321,li,Nemo Sonic Down 0F or -18C – A fantastic winter mummy sleeping bag for staying warm in very cold conditions. They also make a -20F version.,n
331,2,p,Marmot Trestles 15F Synthetic,n
334,2,h2,Comfortable Sleeping Pad,y
336,2,p,"Sleeping pads have come a long way over the years. From bulky rolled pieces of foam, to lightweight inflatable versions with high-tech baffles that take up far less room in your pack. A good sleeping pad can make a huge difference in how much you enjoy camping outside.",n
339,2,li,"Sea to Summit Ether Light XT – I’ve tried countless sleeping pads over the years, and this is my favorite by far. Weighs only 15 ounces, but is insulated and inflates to 4-inches thick. I’ve never slept better in the backcountry!",n
343,2,h2,Backpacker Kitchen,y
353,2,p,You don’t need to lug a ton of pots and pans into the wilderness anymore. A lightweight backpacker kitchen allows you to boil water for cooking simple dehydrated meals on the go.,n
355,2,h3,Camp Stove and Fuel,y
357,2,p,"MSR WindBurner Backpacking Stove – After years of using a JetBoil, I made the switch to MSR’s new system due to better cooking in windy conditions and faster boil times.",n
360,2,h3,Mug or Bowl or Spoon,y
362,2,p,"GSI Infinity Mug – While I could technically use the thin “cup” included with my MSR Windburner stove, I prefer a proper insulated mug that keeps coffee warm longer, with a spill-proof cap.",n
372,2,p,GSI Essential Spoon – Awesome long-handled camping spoon that can reach deep into a dehydrated food bag.,n

420,2,p,"Darn Tough Socks – My favorite brand of hiking socks. As the name implies, they last a long time!",n

427,2,h2,Backpacking Outerwear,y
437,2,p,"These are the outer layers that protect you from nature’s wrath — the wind, rain, and snow. You should always pack some sort of rain gear on any backpacking adventure.",n

455,2,p,Mountain Hardwear Ozonic Pants,n
457,2,h3,Warm Gloves and Hat,y

491,2,h2,Backpacking Food,y

502,2,h3,Trail Mix and Snacks,y
504,2,p,Usually bags of trail mix and some energy bars. I prefer Lara Bars and Clif Protein Bars . These act as both snacks and my lunch. Maybe some Sour Patch Kids or chocolate as an extra treat.,n
