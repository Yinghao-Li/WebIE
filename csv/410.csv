148,62,p,"Without wearing a correctly fitting safety hat or helmet, that meets the current safety standards, you should not get on board a horse. Many riding schools will provide hats for beginners to use, but if you’re going to ride regularly it’s better to have your own.",n
159,62,p,"We recommend visiting a tack shop that has a professional BETA-trained hat fitter , who can advise you on which hat is best suited to your needs, but here are a few suggestions of hats that might suit the beginner rider to point you in the right direction. Plus, we’ve put together even more information about choosing a riding hat here , too.",n
165,62,p,"As a beginner, it doesn’t matter which style of riding hat you choose – jockey skulls and peaked helmets are equally suitable. The main thing is that it fits your head and some styles are more suited to particular head shapes.",n

176,62,p,This hat is lightweight and has 10 ventilation slots to help keep your head cool – a sweaty head is a common problem for riders. It has a soft leather harness and suede padding under the chin for added comfort. It also carries a number of safety standards. It would be worth investing in a hat silk to avoid the “egg head” look.,n

206,62,p,"A horse standing on your toe is painful and can cause significant damage if you aren’t wearing suitable boots. It’s also really important that your boots don’t have too much grip, but have a small heel to prevent your foot slipping through the stirrup.",n
208,62,p,"There are two main types of horse riding boots – long boots or short boots . A long riding boot prevents rubbing on your inside leg, but new riders can find long boots quite restrictive – plus they tend to be more expensive. Ankle-length jodhpur boots allow more flexibility at the ankle and are commonly worn with soft half chaps or gaiters to prevent rubbing on the inside of the calf.",n

257,62,p,"When choosing the right pair of jodhpurs or breeches , you should prioritise how they are going to feel sitting in a saddle – how they look walking around should come second. Breeches are normally worn with long boots, while jodhpurs have a slightly different cut and are better with short boots.",n
261,62,p,"We advise buying a pair that are made of a stretchy fabric with added grip in the relevant places like the knee and under your bottom. When starting out you can choose any colour, but we recommend avoiding white, beige or cream as these are normally worn for competition and hard to keep clean. Riding tights and leggings have become very popular in recent years, but these can be quite slippy – especially if they don’t have added grip – so breeches or jodhpurs are a safer bet.",n

326,62,p,"Seasoned riders often end up with callous hand, particularly between the little and ring finger, which is where the rein passes. To avoid blisters and to keep your hand clean and soft, we recommend you wear a pair of riding gloves . If you would like to take this option, it’s worth investing in a pair of gloves that are manufactured specifically for horse riding. They will be stretchy, grippy and reinforced in the areas where you hold the reins, but thin enough that you’ll be able to have a good feel of what you’re doing.",n

Just as with riding hats, this type of safety equipment needs to be fitted by a BETA-trained retailer. Look out for the BETA level 3 2009 standard or 2018 standard – these show that your body protector meets all the requirements of the European standard.",n
