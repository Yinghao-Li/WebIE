7,5,h4,"Many of us want to volunteer at an animal shelter but just don’t have time. Don’t worry, you can still give by donating supplies.",n
9,5,p,"Today, we’re giving you the ultimate wish list",n
11,5,p,"Our schedules are often packed full of kids’ sports, work, and family events. But the calling to give back is still there, especially if your family has adopted a dog from a shelter. You know the joy that a dog brings to a family and the hard work it takes to get the dog ready for adoption.",n
15,5,p,Animals need our help now more than ever. They are often found in a ditch left for dead or dropped off by owners who can no longer care for them. The job of the animal shelter is to show love and compassion to these animals until a forever home can be found. This mission takes time and countless supplies.,n
17,5,p,"Here’s where you come in. All kinds of supplies are needed to keep a shelter operational. Animals come in wounded or malnourished and need medical care. They come in with broken spirits and need food, a comfortable bed free of feces and fleas, and a loving volunteer to take them for walks.",n
19,5,p,"Sometimes the best care for these dogs is a foster family, like Chase pictured above. What a difference five weeks makes! If the dog needs substantial one on one care, if they are too shy or too energetic, a foster family can nurse and train them to become adoptable.",n
21,5,p,"If you can’t find the time to volunteer, consider purchasing much needed supplies for a shelter in your area. They are always in need of items like medicines, food, blankets, toys, and office supplies.",n
