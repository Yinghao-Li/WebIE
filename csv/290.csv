36,25,p,"If I had to draw one very broad generalization about teachers, it would be that teachers love school supplies. To this day, I am exhilarated by walking down the school supply aisle. I have compiled a list of my favorite teacher supplies, all priced under $20. These are all supplies that I have found useful in my classroom, along with some great ideas for incorporating them. Some supplies you might be able to pick up at Target or Walmart during their back to school sales, but below are Amazon links for your convenience.",n
