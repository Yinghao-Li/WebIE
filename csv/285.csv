212,209,br,"Advanced fencers like to buy new shoes and “break them in” for quite a time before a major competition. As all new shoes stretch during wear, you want your shoe to have enough room so it won’t feel too tight, but not too large, allowing your foot to slip during lunges, and lead to injury.",n

455,448,div,My daughter has been fencing with Olympia Fencing Center for almost 8 years. Their group classes and private lessons have always been intense. When the club was forced to close as a result of COVID-19 I worried that Ava would lose training time and this would impact her when the club was able to re-open. Olympia did not just jump into running online classes. The coaches met and collaborated to figure out the best way to offer online classes for all of their students. They did the same for private lessons which started about two weeks after online group classes started. I'm impressed with the intensity of both the classes and private lessons. Both the classes and private lessons have been comprehensive and intense. Ava has received a great deal of attention in the class and I'm impressed with Coach Daniel's and Coach Julian's attention to detail in her lessons. While this isn't an ideal situation I'm happy she is able to continue her training.,n

Highly recommend to anybody wanting to try a new sport for themselves or their children. Olympia is also keeping up classes during the Covid 19 quarantine offering group and private lessons virtually. They are going above and beyond to keep their members active and engaged during difficult times.,n

I have fenced for most of my life, and genuinely feel privileged to know Danial and Iulia Hondor. They have created a friendly, welcoming, yet highly competitive club. When I wanted to introduce my then 10 year old daughter to fencing, i knew that Daniel would be a great coach. Seven years later and now in college, she has both excelled at fencing and grown through her friendships with club mates. I credit Olympia and fencing for a tremendous experience for her - and for her proud dad!",n
