You might not have the square footage or budget to create a space that replicates your go-to health club or weight room space, but you can make a little bit of gear go a long way if you're dedicated to the idea of getting your sweat on without walking out your front door.",n

More importantly, only select stuff you already know you'll be able to store. Unless you do have room for a full-on garage gym dedicated only to your fitness plan, you're going to want to stow away your training space to transition back to general usage.",n
