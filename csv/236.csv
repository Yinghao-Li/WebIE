1165,1164,text,Okay. I could always switch anchors if your have a better suggestion for what I should use. Right now my anchor is nylon rope with a chain end. I believe the chain is around 6' in length. The boat is a 23' Grampian . Nothing fancy but I think she can make the journey. Will be a bit crampt but I'll make due.,n
1172,1164,br,I can look into a windlass if I upgraded to a larger anchor or longer chain. However my only concerns are if I start adding more electrical needs my battery bank grows. I'm still trying to sort my electrical needs and replenishing capabilities as it is.,n
1181,1164,br,Right now I have 2 deep cycle agm 100ah batteries and 3x 100w solar panels . I was considering investing in a turbine for days where there will be little sun. However people spoke against them especially on such a small boat . I'm also still trying to figure out if I'll be able to run a small fridge or if that is going to drain me too fast. All in all I only have about 1560lbs to work with for adding weight before I start going into the danger zone. I still have myself to deduct from that weight.,n

1415,1395,div,"Your 8 lb anchor with 6 foot of chain is a nice little anchor to row out if needed to keep you from swinging or to use as a stern anchor to keep your bow into the swell so you dont roll all night, but as your main anchor it is way too small. I am a big fan of all chain, but your boat is so light that the weight would effect the sailing too much. 75 to 100 foot of 1 or 4 inch chain and the rest nylon will give you enough chain to never have the nylon against the bottom and yet not be too heavy to handle. A windlass would be nice, but the weight and cost would be more than you might want. A ""chain stopper"" that allows you to pull chain, but doesnt let it slip back out while you are raising the hook will probably work fine and is lighter and less money . You really should carry a third anchor and rode since loosing an anchor is not unusual and only having one is a pain. You dont say where you are located, but swap meets and Craigslist are the budget cruisers friend. Good luck. ____Grant.",n

I could shop around scrap boatyards and see if any have one I could snag but unlikely. The 1 or 4"" chain stopper is reasonably priced. Would I stay around an 8-10lb anchor or upgrade to a 16lb? I estimate the chain at about 73lbs which is going to hurt but if you say that's what it takes to anchor safely. How much nylon should I run for that? Also would I be pulling all that on deck and securing it or is there a better option?",n

1685,1657,text,I am going through the list now. I Will add a handheld vhf in my gear. I've decided for cost at least this trip I am going to go with the Iridium Go and use it with my laptop or phone to get weather alerts as well as have an emergency line to shore. I'll also have the fixed vhf which gives gps as a backup so I can do manual chart plots. I'll maybe grab the handheld Garmin GPS since it's in my budget and keep it along with the handheld vhf with my ditch bag.,n
1696,1657,br,Not sure about storm sails. It looks like a daunting task setting them up especially on such a small boat with not a lot of room to maneuver the deck. I've seen larger boats setting them up with multiple manned crews take 20 minutes. I'm not sure how long it would take on a smaller boat like mine by myself. I'm still kind of leaning towards just reefing my main sail. Do one reef at night to be safe and she can do up to three. I could have a forth reef line added on it which would make it about the size of a storm sail. Again I'm open to opinions on that.,n
