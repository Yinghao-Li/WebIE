71,69,p,"Whether you have potted plants on your balcony, a patio, or a whole yard for gardening, using the right tools for gardening makes a tremendous difference. The many choices for gardening tools can be a bit overwhelming, and there are lots of unnecessary tools on the market that aren't worth taking up valuable storage space.",n
75,69,p,"Here’s a list of must-haves, broken down into two parts: the first five tools every gardener should have, and the remaining seven are essentials for people with backyard gardens. The larger your garden, the more important it is that you have quality tools.",n

98,92,p,"A hand trowel is a must-have multi-purpose tool for digging, scooping soil, removing weeds , and planting. Trowels come in different blade shades, with long or short handles, measuring gauges for seed and bulb depth, hanging holes, and various other features.",n
104,92,p,"A good trowel is strong, sturdy, made of steel with an ergonomic anti-slip rubber handle. Depending on your personal strength, a heavier trowel is better because the heft will make it easier for you to break up compacted soil.",n

120,114,p,"For container gardening, a pair of light, all-purpose gardening gloves with nitrile coating is usually sufficient. Backyard gardeners should have both thinner planting gloves as well as a pair of gloves for heavy-duty tasks such as digging and pruning as a layer of protection against blisters, abrasion, thorns, etc.",n
124,114,p,"These gloves should be long enough that the cuffs cover your wrists. Leather gloves are the most durable, and some come with extra foam padding or cushioning for comfort.",n

143,137,p,Bypass pruners are indispensable for cutting living plant parts such as flower stems and vegetables. They are pricier than carbon steel bypass pruners but stay sharp longer. There are different models for lefties and righties so make sure you purchase the right one.,n

189,185,h2,Spray bottle,y
191,185,p,"For moistening containers with freshly planted seeds and watering the seedlings, a spray bottle comes in handy, because the heavier flow from a watering can or a hose can wash out the soil or topple over tender young plants. Spray bottles are also great for plants that prefer humid environments.",n
195,185,p,"The bottle should be clear so you can see its contents. Spray bottles are often cheaply made and break easily, so spending a few dollars more for a heavier-duty handle and nozzle pays off in the long term.",n

255,249,p,"A shovel gives you more flexibility than a spade. It has a concave, broad blade with a curved sharp tip so you can also scoop up soil whereas a spade has a flat and square blade.",n
259,249,p,"Shovels with a forged blade are more expensive but also more durable. A long-handled shovel, typically between 44 and 48 inches, gives you more leverage making it easier on your back than a short-handled shovel. As for the handle material, fiberglass shovel handles are generally more durable than wooden handles, but either material works fine.",n

320,316,h2,Garden hose with watering wand,y
322,316,p,"Having a garden hose lets you reach any corner of your back yards without having to lug a watering can around. Gardening hoses can be made of rubber, vinyl, or a combination of the two. The hose strength is determined by the number of layers; an 8-ply hose is less likely to collapse and kink than a weaker hose. Likewise, fittings made of brass or heavy aluminum or alloy make a good fit and do not leak.",n
324,316,p,The watering wand is important to get water into hard-to-reach places. It should give you multiple choices for watering patterns. Make sure that the watering wand fits the hose.,n
