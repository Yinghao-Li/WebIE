164,154,br,"The reason behind this is that you will be doing long-term fermentation or aging in this bottle. Using one that is not 1 or 2 will allow oxygen to seep in at the microscopic level. This can cause the wine to become oxidized and have a ""stale"" taste to it. Also, with #7 plastics, you do not know what it is made of. Therefore, you may have chemicals leech into your wine.",n

248,154,br,"Ideally, getting B-T-F iodophor or Star-San 5 Star is the best choice. Follow the directions for mixing. They require no rinse if I remember correctly and the foam from Star San actually helps the yeast!",n

285,282,br,"Just about ANY fruit is capable of being made into a wine. If it's got juice, it's fermentable pretty much. You can go ahead and buy juice from the store. However, make sure you read the ingredients on the label. Concentrate is fine too.",n
288,282,br,"It additives other than Asorbic Acid. If it contains any Sorbate at all, it will not work.",n
290,282,strong,MUST NOT CONTAIN,n
294,282,br,You will need to get enough to match the total amount you want to make. IE- a 5 gallon batch of wine needs 5 gallons of juice.,n
297,282,br,"Alternatively, you can use fresh fruit and get juice from that. The juice you will get is superior to your bottled variety. It is a separate process on it's own, though, so for this Instructable, stick to juices that have already been squeezed for us.",n
300,282,br,juice goes,n
303,282,br,"2. Sugar- Yeast need this to grow. The type of sugar and amount you use will determine your alcohol and flavors. I recommend Corn Sugar, which can bought at health or alternative grocery stores. Homebrew Stores will have plenty on hand.",n
305,282,br,You will need about 4 pounds which cost $.,n
308,282,br,"You can experiment with Brown sugar, white sugar or even honey. Keep in mind though that if you use honey, it will take much longer to ferment.",n
311,282,br,"If you do use sucrose, I recommend creating a simple syrup by using boiling cup of water for every of table sugar. Simple boil the water, stir in the sugar and boil for 10 minutes. You'll end up with a solution that is no longer sucrose, but glucose and fructose, which the yeast find easier to metabolize than sucrose.",n

316,282,strong,2 cups,n
320,282,br,"3. Yeast- The single most important thing to add. Again, a homebrew store is your best friend. I recommend Red Star Montrachet, but you are free to try many types of wine or champagne yeast. It is very cheap @ $.49 usually.",n
323,282,br,"In a pinch or out of necessity, baker's yeast can be used, but expect worse flavors, clouder wine and other defects.",n
326,282,br,Under no circumstances try to use distiller's or high-alcohol yielding yeast. You will regret the decision to ferment with it on the first sip.,n
329,282,br,One packet is generally good,n
332,282,br,Chemicals,n
334,282,br,"These are pretty much going to be found at chemical supply or home brew stores. You don't need a large amount, but they are very cheap and can be used for lots of batches. They do not impart any undesirable flavor to the wine when used properly.",n
337,282,br,"Sodium or Potassium Metabisulfite - Preserves the wine and allows yeast to grow unchallenged. When working with fresh fruit it is necessary or if you plan on using sorbates. You need this if your juice is pasteurized or bought from the store. However, if you got it on the side of the road, I recommend using it. $2.39",n
339,282,strong,MAY NOT,n
342,282,strong,DO NOT USE IF ALLERGIC TO SULFITES,n
346,282,br,NOTE,n
349,282,br,Potassium Sorbate - Let's you add sugar to the wine after fermenting without reactivating the yeast. $2.39,n
351,282,strong,DO NOT ADD IF ALLERGIC TO SORBATES,n
355,282,br,"Yeast Nutrient- Wine tends to be a bit more sparse in building blocks for yeast to thrive in. Giving them some nutrients helps them work faster and help reduce the chance of off flavors. Optional, but recommended $3.19",n
359,282,strong,Word on Chemicals,n
362,282,br,Don't go running just because we are using chemicals. What do you think is in that apple you're eating there? Tons of chemicals.,n
365,282,br,"Unless you are allergic, I'd strongly urge you not to omit the recommended chemicals.This instructable is about making wine, so it would be a shame to leave out what wine maker's have being doing for centuries. If you follow the directions on the label and this instructable, you'll be fine.",n
368,282,br,"Lastly, double check the labeling on the chemicals you get. Some will have varying amounts of ppm. They will usually have some instructions on amount. They may vary from the amounts used in this sample recipe.",n

400,396,br,"You are making a batch of basically acidic sugar water that any mold or bacteria would love to set up shop in. Even though you cannot see them, those spoilers are lying all over your equipment, in every microscopic cranny and nook. Before making wine or any fermented beverage, you need to get rid of them.",n
403,396,br,"Using your chosen sanitizer, make sure your container, stirrer, funnel, air lock parts, measuring spoons and work area are sanitized. You will need to have a contact time of usually 30 seconds. Also make sure your hands are cleaned before beginning or at any step of dealing with the wine.",n
406,396,br,"If you are using bleach, you will need to follow with a rinse to get any standing solution off, which means you need clean water. I suggest distilled water, but I also suggest .",n

413,396,strong,Why not sterilize?,n
416,396,br,"Sterilize means to kill all life off a surface. Nothing survives. Sanitation means to reduce the amount of bacteria, wild yeasts, etc. to negligible levels. You will be hard pressed to sterilize unless you can fit all of your equipment into a boiling pot or can autoclave it.",n

And on a side note: if your wine is rather tart or even a little bitter it usually means it's a dry style wine so don't hate it. might just need a little aging to mature.",n

Many tutorials that I have read attach the airlock immediately after mixing in their sugar and yeast, but other sites instruct you to only cover the bucket with a towel to allow airflow for a while first. Which is correct? Which is better? Won't leaving the wine open to oxygen potentially contaminate it? My goal is to make tasty wine for long term storage . Thanks in advance!",n

1401,1398,br,"I had a load of fresh black currents I had no use for, so decided to fill some very large jam jars with water, some sugar, and the berries. I was just gonna leave them like that, but in the fridge till I could use them soon.",n

1407,1398,br,Yes. It was fermenting just as it was.,n
1409,1398,br,"I moved the other jars into the same cupboard, and knowing that all the books ""fermentation lock"", I decided to try screwing the lids full on, then slowly loosen them so that the yeast when expelling oxygen would build up a tiny bit of pressure which should, I hoped, keep air from getting in, but would keep the oxygen flowing out.",n
1411,1398,br,"After a few.days the fermenting in most of the jars.slowed, so I bought a.cheap.pack of bread yeast, dropped.a.little in each jar and forgot about them for over a week and a half.",n

1438,1398,br,"And as this, albiet slight, pressure is greater than the pressure in the surrounding room, gasses can escape, but also ""push"" out external gasses, making it difficult for external contaminants to enter.",n
