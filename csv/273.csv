24,22,p,Have you ever wondered what exactly dry shampoo is and how it works? How about what the difference is between pomade and hair oil? Or the best way to use your shampoo and conditioner to keep your 'do fresh?,n
28,22,p,"Your hair products are the first and most important step to achieving a desired look or hairstyle. Without the correct hair care products, you can kiss that beachy boho look or sleek chignon goodbye!",n
30,22,p,"In this blog post, we're going back to basics to give you the run down on 10 everyday hair products every girl should have and know how to use them to their fullest potential, to ensure lovely locks and healthy hair.",n
33,22,h1,Shampoo - are you using the right one?,n
35,22,p,"We all know what shampoo is - simply put, it cleanses the hair. But here's where it gets tricky: there are tons of different types of shampoos out there. From clarifying shampoo to volumizing shampoo, straightening and smoothing, sulfate-free, and shampoos for color treated hair, it's important to choose the type of shampoo that is best suited for your specific hair.",n
37,22,h3,Clarifying shampoo,y
39,22,p,Clarifying shampoo roughens up the hair cuticle and gets the roots extra squeaky clean. This can be used when you feel that there is too much product buildup in your hair or before getting a chemical treatment done like coloring or perming.,n
42,22,p,"Our Charcoal Detox Shampoo is a great example of a clarifying shampoo since it is designed to deeply cleanse the hair and scalp. The activated charcoal goes to work pulling out dirt, toxins, and impurities from the hair while ingredients like aloe vera and grape seed oil ensure that hair stays moisturized and hydrated. If you are experiencing product buildup, unpleasant odors, or an itchy scalp, a clarifying shampoo like this is your best bet.",n
46,22,h3,Volumizing shampoo,y
48,22,p,"This kind of shampoo is designed to open up the hair cuticle and make it thicker, however, in order to get your hair nice and fluffy, try to pick a shampoo with a lightweight conditioning ingredient that rinses off well and doesn't weigh the hair down.",n
50,22,h3,Smoothing shampoo,y
52,22,p,"Shampoos that straighten and smooth the hair usually have silicone or oil in them to coat the hair strands. When the hair is styled with a straightener, the result is magical!",n
54,22,h3,Shampoo,y
57,22,p,"If your hair is colored, we recommend going for a shampoo specifically designed for color treated hair. Check the product's pH level and ensure that it is between 4.5-5.5 to prevent color from fading. Great hair products for dyed hair will also include ingredients like oils, sea kelp or algae, in order to lock in color.",n
60,22,p,"If you happen to have hair that has been dyed to a lighter, blonder shade, consider switching to a purple shampoo like our Balancing Purple Shampoo . Infused with purple pigments designed to combat unwanted brassiness or yellow tones in the hair, this shampoo will help you maintain a brilliant shade of blonde between salon visits.",n
65,22,p,"While dyeing the hair a lighter color can make it vulnerable to damage, this formula features ingredients like organic babassu oil and avocado oil to deep condition dry strands. This vegan hair product can be used on both your natural hair and hair extensions to improve texture, color, and overall shine.",n
67,22,h3,Alcohol and sulfate-free shampoo,y
69,22,p,"Alcohol and sulfate-free shampoos are our favorite! Sulfates are detergents with long names that we can't even pronounce. While sulfate-based shampoos are great for cleaning oil and dirt from your hair, they can seriously dry out your hair and cause damage like split ends. We prefer things au natural. Organic and sulfate-free hair products can lock in moisture and natural oils, retain hair dye, and reduce scalp irritation.",n
72,22,p,"Whichever shampoo you choose, be sure that it's right for the texture of your hair. If you choose a shampoo that's too clarifying, you could strip the hair of its natural oils, and lead to additional oil being produced. If you choose a shampoo that's too moisturizing, you could end up with product buildup at the scalp. If you're not sure what type of hair you have, you can always consult your hair stylist for a recommendation.",n
74,22,p,"Also, be sure to choose two ""go-to"" shampoos that both have different ingredients and benefits to rotate between, to maintain balance in your hair. Switch your shampoo every 4 to 5 washes to remove product buildup and restore cleanliness to your hair shafts.",n
76,22,h1,Conditioner,y
78,22,p,"Hair conditioner is designed to smoothen, restore moisture, and help you say goodbye to frizzy hair . There are three main types of conditioners you can use to reach Rapunzel level #hairgoals.",n
82,22,h3,Rinse-out conditioner,y
85,22,p,"Rinse-out conditioners are the most common type of conditioner, worked through the ends of your hair, left in for a few minutes, and rinsed out. Avoid applying conditioner to the roots of your hair, as this could result in extra buildup and weigh the hair down.",n
88,22,p,"If you’re hoping to restore moisture to your hair after shampooing, give our High-Gloss Smoothing Conditioner a try. This deeply hydrating conditioner is formulated for everyday use and will leave hair feeling incredibly shiny, soft, and smooth. It contains a host of nourishing oils and vitamins, such as baobab, shea butter, linseed, and vitamin B-5 so your hair will be stronger and tangle-free.

96,22,h3,Hair mask and deep conditioner,y
99,22,p,"Hair masks or deep conditioners are perfect for repairing dry and damaged hair.

109,22,p,"Be sure to avoid the common mistake of only rinsing out half of the conditioner! We all love that glorious, silky, smooth feeling conditioners leave, however, this means you haven't rinsed out all the product from your hair and you're actually weighing your hair down!",n
112,22,h1,Hair oils and serums,y
114,22,p,"From argan oil to baobab oil to coconut oil , hair oil is a must for those with 'problematic' hair. They tame frizz, add shine, promote growth, and give your hair a luxe, polished look.
