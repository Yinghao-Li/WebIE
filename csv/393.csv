271,261,p,"It’s my favorite time of the year – spring cleaning season! Want to do a little spring cleaning too? Every year I do a some type of organized spring cleaning here on the blog and in our home and this year is no different. I’ll be introducing the challenge later this week with a free printable guide, but in the meantime, I thought it would be fun to gather supplies and essentials. Maybe it’s just me, but gearing up for a cleaning endeavor is definitely more fun than the cleaning itself. By gathering supplies it ensures that we’re ready to do a little bit of cleaning every day or for a few days in a row and stay on track with spring cleaning. Want to give it a whirl too? Here’s what you need to get started.",n
