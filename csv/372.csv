319,296,p,"If you're looking for an inexpensive six drawer wooden cart for your sewing or crafting room, this cart is the perfect choice. I ordered two carts to use as the leg supports for a improvised sewing table. The top of my sewing table is a 60"" by 18"" wooden board that's 3 or 4"" thick purchased from my local big box home improvement store. This set up is the perfect height, length and width for my sewing machine and serger. The six drawers on each cart hold an amazing amount of sewing notions, tools and supplies, all within easy grabbing distance when I'm ""creating"" at my machines. And best of all, the drawers slide in and out easily, which wasn't the case with the plastic carts I'd used previously. I spray painted my two carts with flat black spray paint to go with the decor in my sewing room, and I'd recommend spray paint for anyone who wants something other than the light wooden finish the kit comes with. The only real drawback is the amount of time and effort it takes to assemble the cart. You're not just screwing on a few legs, you're assembling the entire cart and each of the six drawers. Plus some steps are tricky and require practice, and you're inserting dozens of screws which have guide holes on only one of the pieces you're attaching. Still, I'm a retired woman in my sixties, and I was able to get a good result using only an ordinary Phillips screwdriver, a hammer and a rubber mallet. The first cart took me six hours, the second took somewhat less.But if you're on a budget and have the time, this cart is a wonderful choice for a sewing or crafting room. It looks and functions like the carts that cost two or three times as much. And that leaves more money for fabrics, yarn, and other goodies. Pros: Solid wood, reasonably priced, reasonably sturdy, simple modern lines.Cons: Takes hours to assemble",n

I also knew that it meant I was going to need to organize my Cutlery drawers ...there was no way I was letting my new gorgeous flatware be banged around every time I open and close my drawers ..a quick search here on Wayfair produced this amazing drawer organizer and when I saw the price I knew I had to grab it, there was no way I was going to find something that large for that cheap! I figured once I received it if it was even a fraction of what I was hoping for that would be okay because of what I paid.. first let me tell you that it arrived days earlier than anticipated AND the shipping was free , I belong to the Wayfair MyWay program, which I might add has paid for itself many times over! This drawer organizer is by no means lightweight , the construction is solid, the metal is quite sturdy and it has definite weight to it ,.Ive included photos of the extensive set of flatware that fits perfectly in it ..Im sure this organizer can hold double of what I have laid out on the table, so I am ordering two more to accommodate my other sets I have already ordered from Wayfair!
