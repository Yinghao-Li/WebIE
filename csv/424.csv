1288,1286,span,,n
1291,1288,div,"My husband always tells me that I need to be a professional suitcase-tester. I'm obsessive . I fly a few times a year, sometimes alone on work-related trips, sometimes with my family for pleasure. And I try to pack with the thought that I have to maneuver my bags on my own via public transit . I used to Uber everywhere on trips, but I honestly love public transit a lot more . So, my priority is to pack as efficiently as possible knowing that I *may* have to schlep suitcases down a flight of stairs to get on a train . And as I mentioned, I'm a firm believer in carry-on only these days, so that's what I'm sharing. My biggest requirement is four spinner wheels and durable enough to hold my purse on top of it while I park it in front of me at the airport . ***Don't forget to pack your printable packing list INSIDE your suitcase so you make sure to pack up all of the stuff you brought with you.***",n

Please note: this is a hard-sided suitcase , but if you're not used to it, it does open down the middle with two equal compartments. This isn't an issue for me since I unpack in hotels. But, if you live out of your suitcase on the road, it can be awkward to set on a hotel luggage rack.",n
1307,1297,li,"If you are really skilled at compact packing, I used to carry this Delsey suitcase . It was neat because my laptop fit in the front compartment . Because of the laptop compartment, the clothing compartment is rather small, so I can go only two nights max with this one due to its size. Again, this is another hard-side suitcase that has the same configuring I mentioned above .",n
