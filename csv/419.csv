606,602,p,"There’s many “gear lists” out there, but they always seemed to be missing something or weren’t specific to bike touring. With that said, unless one is embarking on a world tour or to remote regions, not everything on the list is needed, and many times might be overkill… Your legs will thank you with a “less is more” attitude! Also, I listed some specific product brands as examples, although I’m not endorsing those products in any way. If anyone thinks I missed anything on this list, let me or Darren know… Happy Touring!",n

640,633,p,"Darren, I just saw your Twitter post asking for questions. Hopefully this gear checklist is relevant to my situation. I’m planning my first tour and I don’t know how much storage space I’m really going to need, so I don’t want to overbuy . I’m trying to go ultralight and minimalist and still keep the cost down while using quality goods. The only item I have so far is a Marmot synthetic baselayer, which weighs under 6 oz. I have a wish list for the rest of the gear, but am still flexible on what exactly I’ll be using. When a pannier is described by its volume in liters, all I can think of is “how many 2 liters of Coke will I have in gear?” Is there a better way to figure out how much space you really need without already having the gear or doing crazy measuring? My trip will be from Kansas City to Washington, DC and then over to the Atlantic Ocean and take place in June. My 1980’s Bianchi Grizzly has fender or rack eyelets on the front and back. Thanks.",n

660,657,br,"1. you wouldn’t use panniers or a rack, and stick with a backpacking set up. But I know this question was asked in 2010.",n
662,657,br,"2. Buy a reasonable to small size pannier. This will force you to only pack as much as you can fit inside. The more storage capacity you have the more things you will pack, but when your limited then you get creative.",n
664,657,br,3. There is also room for a full size tent or large bag on the handle bars. Just gotta figure out how you want to strap it.,n
666,656,p,"4. Now adays there are A TON of affordable options. But when I first started, I threw on an aluminum rack, zip ties, bungiee cords and just used whatever backpack or bag I had laying around and strapped her on the rack. I even read of people using kitty litter tubs. Bungee cord bag onto the handlebar and your set.",n
667,656,p,,n
668,667,text,"5. How to pack ultra light? Only bring what you can wear and have to use. I think underwear and socks are the only clothing you would need 2 pairs of. Otherwise no need to double up on shirts, shorts or pants. only 1 of each if you have to bring it. Just wash your clothes a lot, thats life on the road.",n
670,667,br,Camping set up is probably the largest volume and weight.,n
672,667,br,"Food, go no stove only cold foods",n
674,667,br,Tech or camera- this can weigh the most. between gear and batterys. Just make sure you use if you bring it. I bring 2x Bat of each and bring a battery + solar to charge.,n
676,667,br,"bike tools- dont cheap out on weight on tubes, patches and neccessary tools for your loaction. Better safe than sorry, but beyond basics. at most a chain breaker, but idk how to put a chain back together so I’m not sure why i bring one.",n
678,667,br,Dish wash soap,n
680,656,p,Clothes and camp set up is probably the biggest weight. I still pack to be comfortable and extra warm in case. Id rather be warm and heavy than the alternative. BUT you can always BUY more layers so bring the minimum to below average.,n

699,697,p,"Jaron, that’s a good question. I think the best way to know what size panniers to get is to pack up all the stuff you think you are going to need for your trip and bundle it all together. Remember how big that pile looks. Then try and find some panniers at your local REI or sporting goods store and see which panniers you think will hold all the stuff you have packed. Remember though that you need to have some extra space inside your panniers for extra food and water you might pick up along the way, as well as an additional items or souvenirs you might acquire while on your travels.",n
701,697,p,When I bought my first set of panniers I just got the largest set Lone Peak made because I knew that I could always ride with less stuff than the panniers held… and I knew I’d have the room needed if I did want to pick up some additional stuff along the way. Does that make sense?,n

716,711,div,,n
718,716,p,"Jaron, Darren’s suggestion is a wise idea assuming you find a local store, before buying them. If you cannot find any to test fit, I would be more concerned with getting quality bags, rather then too concerned with size. Volume runs from about 600cu to well over 3,000 cu inches. Most pairs are approx 1,500-3,000 cu in. Jandd Expeditions are enormous. Since I don’t know how much gear you’re hauling, and if I had to guess, I’d get at least 1,500cu bags up front and at least 2,500cu on rear.",n
720,716,p,"On 2 tours, I used Lone Peaks P-400s on the rear rack, LP bar bag, but no front panniers, as I didn’t have any. I thought the P-400s were small; had to bungee my tent, sleeping bag and foam pad above the rack, plus a small daypack above all that which made for a back heavy ride. I don’t recommend touring with a “rear only” setup as it put a lot of stress on your back wheel. Since then I’ve been using a BOB trailer , but I recently got some Axiom Champlain and Lasalle panniers. I haven’t tried the Lasalles yet, but they are 40L or 2440 cubic inches and intend to use them up front. I’ve used the Champlains over a weekend ride—huge, but still needed a little room for a tent and food bag Remember, you can always haul less stuff in larger panniers; you’ll be strapping extra shit over your bike if you get small bags. As Darren said, you want to leave some spare room for food, water, and gifts. I recommend you go with front + rear panniers + handlebar bag setup, which allow you to carry everything in panniers, and you may still have room inside your panniers, if you go light as you said.",n
722,716,p,"As for brands, Axiom or Lone Peaks are a solid choice for budget buyers. to be a steal and they are way better quality than Nashbar or Performance bike brands I can vouch for either, although I haven’t done a long tour with the Axioms yet. If you have the scratch and want to make an investment in the best gear, go for Arkels, but they are very $$$. I recently got fed up with a Nashbar bag and got an Arkel bar bag—the best! If you want high quality AND want or need waterproof, get Ortliebs. They’re world popular for a reason, although you give up organizing convenience of pockets.",n

The size and weight of a bivy are obviously attractive features, but in day-to-day application for bike touring, you’ll appreciate a tent with a bit more elbow room. Ever set up a bivy in a rainstorm, then try to wrestle out of wet clothes without touching the tent walls? It’s not fun! And sometimes the ground is too hard to stake down in. Assuming you’re going solo, I recommend a 2-man, freestanding tent you can sit up in. Little chance you’ll notice the extra 2-3 pounds of weight as long as you keep your overall gear weight down to a reasonable total.",n

I’ve had other Bicycle Touring Pro readers try to tour with carbon frames, forks, etc… and it doesn’t end well much of the time. Carbon bikes are not made for touring – they are made to carry you and nothing else. I suggest you read “ The Essential Guide To Touring Bicycles ” and pick up a copy of “ The Bicycle Touring Blueprint .” Those two books will teach you everything you need to know for your upcoming trip – which bike to use, what gear you need, which items are essential and which are not, how to plan a safe and enjoyable route, how to find safe places to sleep each night, etc, etc, etc. That’s where I would start!",n

We will be packing on the heavy side because we don’t have a timeline. If we only get 30 miles in a day then so what and if we really like a place we might stay for a few days. We will be riding bikes with pedal assist to make sure our retirement cruise is more enjoyable than grueling but we will make sure to pack a wine key and buy local wine when we get to California. All of the insight on this page has helped us pack but everyone’s journey is different.

One thing I suggested which I found to be a big help for its size was a ‘wheel lock’, small gizmo that fits on tube just behind front wheel, and when you lean your bike a giant something you click it into position against the tire and it ‘locks’ the front wheel to stop it from the inevitable wheel twist and subsequent crashing down of the loaded bike. She hadn’t heard of this and when I have looked it up I cannot find this . Wondering if you know about these and if you know if source or at least what it is being referred to as currently. I’m pretty sure the one I have I got either through mountain equipment in the early days or Bloor cycle in Toronto Ont.",n
