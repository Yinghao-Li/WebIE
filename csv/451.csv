169,131,p,"Be prepared for changing weather, even if it's not in the forecast. Take a rain jacket and consider dressing in layers so you can pull on or remove items as the weather changes.

215,201,div,"The equipment required for hiking depends on the length of the hike, but day hikers generally carry at least water, food, a map, and rain-proof gear. Hikers usually wear sturdy hiking boots for mountain walking and backpacking, as protection from the rough terrain, as well as providing increased stability. The Mountaineers club recommends a list of ""Ten Essentials"" equipment for hiking, including a compass, a trekking pole, sunglasses, sunscreen, a flashlight, a first aid kit, a fire starter, and a knife. Other groups recommend items such as hat, gloves, insect repellent, and an emergency blanket. A GPS navigation device can also be helpful and route cards may be used as a guide.",n

241,238,text,- I would strongly favor hiking boots over athletic shoes. Unless they are high top style shoes they lack the support to help prevent ankle injuries.,n

244,242,strong,Signal mirror and whistle,n
245,242,text,"-These two items can make the difference between being found or not if lost or injured. Some packs have a whistle built into the sternum strap buckle, or you can buy such a buckle aftermarket and replace the existing buckle.",n

248,246,strong,strong cord and bandana,n
249,246,text,"-Having a few feet of strong, small diameter cord can help if you need to make splint, and combined with the bandana can create a sling for an injured arm. The bandana on its own is useful for other things too.",n

252,250,strong,Fire building,n
253,250,text,"-It's actually not so easy to build a fire. One tip to make it easier to start a fire is to bring your own fire starter. Cotton balls work very well for this purpose, are very light and take up little space in a pack. Even better than dry cotton balls are cotton balls soaked in olive oil. One can also bring small wax candles for this purpose.",n
