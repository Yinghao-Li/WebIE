457,439,text,"Especially as the ball encounters greater friction in the last ≈20 feet of the lane, the ball's axis rotation causes the ball to hook away from its original direction.",n
464,439,text,"Concurrently, lane friction continually decreases the angle of axis rotation until it exactly matches the direction of the ball's forward motion, and rev rate increases until it exactly matches the ball's forward speed: full traction is achieved and the ball enters the roll phase in which forward speed continues to decrease.",n

538,531,text,"The following discussion considers delivery characteristics separately, with the understanding that ball motion is determined by a complex interaction of a variety of factors.",n
544,18,p,"Greater ball speeds give the ball less time to hook, thus reducing observed hook though imparting more kinetic energy to the pins; conversely, slower speeds allow more time for greater hook though reducing kinetic energy.",n
550,18,p,"Greater rev rates cause the ball to experience more frictional lane contact per revolution and thus greater and earlier hook ; conversely, smaller rev rates cause less frictional engagement and allow the ball to hook less and later .",n
553,18,p,,n
554,553,text,"Analysis of the influence of axis rotation is more complex: There is a degree of axis rotation—generally 25° to 35° and varying with ball speed and rev rate—that may be considered optimal in that hook is maximized; however, this optimum axis rotation also causes minimal length.",n
561,553,text,"Specifically, Freeman and Hatfield report optimal axis rotation to be arcsin",n

574,553,text,"Below and above optimal axis rotation, more length and less hook are encountered, with greater-than-optimal axis rotation causing a sharper hook.",n
578,18,p,"Greater degrees of initial axis tilt cause the ball to rotate on smaller-circumference ""tracks"" , thus reducing the amount of frictional contact to provide greater length and less hook; conversely, smaller degrees of axis tilt involve larger-circumference tracks with more frictional contact per revolution, thus providing less length and more hook.",n
582,18,p,"Loft—the distance past the foul line at which the ball first contacts the lane—determines the effective length of the lane as experienced by the ball: greater loft distances effectively shorten the lane and provide greater length, while smaller loft distances engage the lane earlier and cause an earlier hook.",n
