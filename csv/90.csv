91,89,h2,Crossfit Equipment,y
93,89,p,"Crossfit is a multidisciplinary sport that utilizes functional movements to produce difficult workouts. What makes it multidisciplinary is the fact that there is Olympic lifting, calisthenics, free weight exercises, long distance running, sprints, and even swims incorporated into the workouts. For this reason, a good amount of equipment is needed in order to participate in the sport.",n
97,29,div,,n
99,97,h2,Accessories,y
101,97,p,"Crossfit is a sport with multiple disciplines of fitness, so there will be a lot of accessories that cover all of them. For example, you need a barbell and bumper plates for Olympic lifts such as power cleans and jerks. However, you will also need kettlebells for swings, presses, squats, and many more. The key to being successful in crossfit is having the necessary equipment to participate in the workouts. You can always improvise, but having the ones listed down below are highly recommended.",n
102,29,div,,n
104,102,h2,Barbells,y
106,102,p,"If you are going to get into crossfit, then it is almost impossible to avoid compound lifts such as the deadlift, back squat, press, snatch, and the clean and jerk. All of these lifts are done with barbells.",n
108,102,p,"The standard barbell in crossfit is the Olympic bar. This is 7.2 feet tall, 2 inches in diameter, and weighs 45 pounds. These are about $300.",n
110,102,p,"Another common barbell in a crossfit gym is the hex-bar. This is a hexagonal bar that you can step into, and do exercises such as deadlifts, or farmer walks. This allows the barbell to be at the center of your body. When you do deadlifts with a traditional barbell, the weight is out in front of you and puts more pressure on your back. They can cost between $90-250.",n
111,29,div,,n
113,111,h2,Barbell Safety Collars,y
115,111,p,"A huge part of crossfit is training with barbells. This is naturally going to be dangerous because you are loading weight on either end of the barbell, and throwing it around for Olympic lifts. A step you can take to prevent any injuries is getting some barbell collars. These attach to the outside of the barbell and keep your weight in place so it does not slip out. If you do not have collars, your weight may begin to slip to the outside of your barbell, and cause you to tip over.",n
117,111,p,"These come in different shapes and styles, so here are some things you should consider.",n
119,111,p,"First, you should look into what type of collar you want. There are two main types of collars: spring clip and hexagon clip.",n
121,111,p,The spring clip has a plastic end to it where you can squeeze and expand the clip so it can slide into the barbell. They cost about $20.,n
123,111,p,"Hexagon clips are made of plastic or nylon, and have rubber interiors that hold the bar in place. You can simply flip a latch and the barbell is secure. It is quicker and more efficient than the spring clip, but both get the job done. A good hexagon clip can cost $22.",n
124,29,div,,n
126,124,h2,Battle Ropes,y
128,124,p,"Some people do not get into crossfit because it is difficult, but most of the equipment is fun to use. One of those is the battle rope.

On top of that, you are using your entire body during movements, making it an extremely functional piece of equipment. Battle ropes come in different lengths and weights, so prices can range from $50-90.",n

131,124,ul,,n
133,131,li,Rope Slams,y
135,131,li,Rope Russian Twists,y
137,124,p,"With a battle rope slam exercise you start with the rope down by your legs, raise them up above your head while getting on your toes, and then slam hard. This trains your shoulders, legs and core.",n
139,124,p,"With a battle rope Russian twist exercise you start in a seated position with the rope on one side of your body. Then you twist your torso while keeping your legs still and slam the rope on the other side. You should lean back far enough to feel this in your core, but not too far back where you fall.",n
140,29,div,,n
142,140,h2,Boxes,y
145,140,p,"Crossfit boxes are used for box jumps. They are also known as plyo-boxes because they are short for plyometric. Plyometric exercises are anything that is explosive; for example, box jumps and clapping push ups.",n

158,156,h2,Bumper Weights,y
160,156,p,"In a traditional gym, weights are made of metal and are not meant to be slammed on the floor. However, in crossfit, bumper plates are used. These are weights that are slid onto each side of a barbell. They are made of rubber which makes the weight bounce in the air after it is used, and is therefore less likely to break.",n
