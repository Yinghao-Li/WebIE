That way, you can print out any pages you want and highlight them or make notes on them as much as you’d like.",n
174,150,p,"But at the end of the day, outside of enrolling in your course and making sure you have access to the internet, there are no physical materials required for you to purchase in order to complete the majority of NYIAD’s programs.
